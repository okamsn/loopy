;;; Commentary:
;; `loopy' is a macro that is used similarly to `cl-loop'.  It provides "loop
;; commands" that define a loop body and it's surrounding environment, as well
;; as exit conditions.
;;
;; For more information, see Loopyâ€™s README.org or the Info files derived from
;; that README with the command `info'.
;;
;; This package provides extra functions to use `pcase' for destructuring
;; in `loopy'.
