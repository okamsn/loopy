~loopy~ is a macro meant for iterating and looping.  It is similar in usage to
~cl-loop~ ([[info:cl#Loop Facility]]) but uses parenthesized expressions rather than
keyword clauses.

For most cases, ~loopy~ is a featureful replacement for ~cl-loop~ and
complementary to Emacs's built-in looping and mapping features (such as the
libraries =seq= ([[info:elisp#Sequence Functions]]) and =cl-lib= ([[info:cl]])).

* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: A short overview of features.
:END:

Loopy is a library for looping and iteration, with supplemental features for
destructuring.  Upfront, the features provided are summarized below.  They are
described thoroughly later in this document.

- ~loopy~ :: A macro similar to ~cl-loop~.  Unlike ~cl-loop~, ~loopy~ uses
  parenthesized expressions instead of "clauses".

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; A simple usage of `cl-loop':
    (cl-loop for i from 1 to 10
             if (cl-evenp i) collect i into evens
             else collect i into odds
             end ; This `end' keyword is optional here.
             finally return (list odds evens))

    ;; How it could be done using `loopy':
    (loopy (numbers i :from 1 :to 10)
           (if (cl-evenp i)
               (collect evens i)
             (collect odds i))
           (finally-return odds evens))
  #+end_src

- ~loopy-iter~ :: A macro similar to Common Lisp's Iterate macro ([[#loopy-iter]]).
  Unlike Common Lisp's ~loop~, the ~iterate~ macro allows the embedding of its
  looping constructs inside of arbitrary code.  To be clear, ~loopy-iter~ is
  _not_ a port of ~iterate~ to Emacs Lisp.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((1 2 3) (-3 -2 -1) (0))
    (loopy-iter (numbering i -3 3)
                (pcase i
                  ((pred cl-plusp)  (collecting positives i))
                  ((pred cl-minusp) (collecting negatives i))
                  (_                (collecting other i)))
                (finally-return positives negatives other))
  #+end_src

- ~loopy-let*~, ~loopy-setq~, ~loopy-lambda~, and ~loopy-ref~ :: Destructuring
  macros that can be used outside of ~loopy~ and ~loopy-iter~
  ([[#basic-destructuring]]).  For convenience, Loopy provides its own form of
  destructuring, which is similar to, though more featureful than, that provided
  by =cl-lib=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (1 2 3 (:k1 4) 4)
    (loopy-let* (((a b c &rest d &key k1) (list 1 2 3 :k1 4)))
      (list a b c d k1))

    ;; => ((7 2 8) [9 2 10])
    (let ((my-list (list 1 2 3))
          (my-vector  (vector 1 2 3)))
      (loopy-ref (((a _ c) my-list)
                  ([d _ e] my-vector))
        (setf a 7 c 8 d 9 e 10)
        (list my-list my-vector)))
  #+end_src


Some other things to note are:
- ~loopy~ (and so ~loopy-iter~) support destructuring for both iteration and
  accumulation commands.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Summing the nth elements of arrays:
    ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
    (loopy (list (list-elem1 list-elem2)
                 '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
                   ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
           (sum [sum1 sum2 sum3] list-elem1)
           (sum [sum4 sum5 sum6] list-elem2)
           (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3 sum4 sum5 sum6))

    ;; Separate the elements of sub-list:
    ;; => ((1 3) (2 4))
    (loopy (list i '((1 2) (3 4)))
           (collect (elem1 elem2) i)
           (finally-return elem1 elem2))
  #+end_src

- The looping macros are configurable and extensible.  One can create their own
  loop commands and command aliases.  "Flags" can be used to configure the
  looping macros' behavior, such as by using an alternative destructuring system
  like =pcase= or the Dash library.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Use `pcase' to destructure array elements:
    ;; => ((1 2 3 4) (10 12 14) (11 13 15))
    (loopy (flag pcase)
           (array (or `(,car . ,cdr) digit)
                  [1 (10 . 11) 2 (12 . 13) 3 4 (14 . 15)])
           (if digit
               (collect digits digit)
             (collect cars car)
             (collect cdrs cdr))
           (finally-return digits cars cdrs))
  #+end_src


- Compared to ~cl-loop~, more constructs are provided for how loops are
  completed and values returned.  For example, the =leave= command will exit the
  loop without changing what would be returned.  This is a more generic form of
  =while= and =until=, though those are also provided.  =after-do=
  (a.k.a. =else-do=) is a construct that runs Lisp code only when the loop
  completes successfully, similar to Python's ~else~ statement after ~for~ and
  ~while~ loops.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (1 3 5)
    (loopy (numbers i :from 1 :to 10)
           (cond ((cl-evenp i) (skip))
                 ((> i 5)      (leave)))
           (collect i))

    ;; => (t nil)
    (loopy (with (always-run)
                 (run-when-complete))
           (numbers i :from 1 :to 10)
           (while (< i 4))
           (after-do   (setq run-when-complete t))
           (finally-do (setq always-run t))
           (finally-return always-run run-when-complete))
  #+end_src

- One can declare which accumulations should be optimized (and so treated as
  implied variables).  This can make accumulation into multiple named variables
  much faster.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Expands into the efficient `push'-`nreverse' idiom, not
    ;; the `nonc'-`list' idiom that would be used by `cl-loop'.
    (loopy (accum-opt cars cdrs)
           (array elem [(1 . 2) (3 . 4)])
           (collect (cars . cdrs) elem)
           (finally-return cars cdrs))
  #+end_src

That being said, Loopy is not yet feature complete.  Please request features or

* Basic Concepts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: basic-concepts
:DESCRIPTION: Basic information about `loopy' and its loops.
:END:

Except for an optional loop name, all arguments of the ~loopy~ macro are
parenthesized expressions.  These expressions can, for example, assign variables
local to the loop, add code that runs before/after the loop, and/or set the
ultimate return value of the macro.

For convenience and clarity, expressions that generate code in the loop body are
called "loop commands" ([[#loop-commands][Loop Commands]]).  Expressions that generate code around
the loop are called "special macro arguments" or just "macro arguments" as
opposed to "loop commands" ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]).

"Loop commands" are the main building blocks of the ~loopy~ macro, such as the
command =list= in the expression =(list i '(1 2 3))=.  A command inserts code
into the loop body, but can also perform additional setup like initializing
variables.  Many commands set a condition for ending the loop.  In the case of
=list=, the command iterates through the elements of a list, binding the
variable ~i~ to each element.  After iterating through all elements, the loop is
forced to end.

In general, a loop ends when any looping condition required by a loop command
evaluates to ~nil~.  If no conditions are needed, then the loop runs infinitely
until a early-exit command is reached ([[#exiting-the-loop-early][Exiting the Loop Early]]).

The default return value of the loop is ~nil~.  Other return values must be
stated explicitly, as in one of the early-exit commands or part of the
=finally-return= macro argument, or come from accumulating loop commands using
an implied accumulation variable ([[#accumulation-commands][Accumulation Commands]]).

The ~loopy~ macro is configurable.  One can add custom commands
([[#adding-custom-commands][Custom Commands]]), add custom command aliases ([[#custom-aliases][Custom Aliases]]), and specify
macro options for a particular loop ([[#flags][Using Flags]]).  Each of these ideas is
explained in detail later in this document.

* Special Macro Arguments
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: macro-arguments
:DESCRIPTION: Creating the environment of the loop.
:END:

#+cindex: special macro argument
There are only a few special macro arguments.  One, an unquoted symbol, is taken
as the loop's name.  The others, listed below, are parenthesized expressions
that begin with a keyword or one of their aliases.

If a macro argument does not match one of these special few, ~loopy~ will
attempt to interpret it as a loop command, and signal an error if that fails.

These special macro arguments are always processed before loop commands,
regardless of the order of the arguments passed to ~loopy~.

#+findex: with
#+findex: let*
#+findex: init
- =with=, =let*=, =init= :: Declare variables before the loop, in order.  This
  can also be used to initialize variables referenced by loop commands.  =with=
  can use destructuring ([[#basic-destructuring]]).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (4 5 6)
    (loopy
     (with (a 1)          ; Set `a' to 1.
           (b (1+ a)))    ; Set `b' to 1+1=2.
     (list i '(1 2 3))    ; Bind `i' to elements of the list.
     (collect (+ i a b))) ; Collect sum of `a', `b', and each `i' into a list.

    ;; => 16
    (loopy
     (let* (my-sum 10))       ; Bind `my-sum' to 10.
     (list i '(1 2 3))        ; Bind `i' to elements of the list.
     (sum my-sum i)           ; Set `my-sum' to `i' + `my-sum'.
     (finally-return my-sum)) ; Return the value of `my-sum'.
  #+end_src

#+findex: without
#+findex: no-with
#+findex: no-init
- =without=, =no-with=, =no-init= :: Variables that ~loopy~ should not try to
  initialize.  ~loopy~ tries to initialize all of the variables that it uses
  in a ~let~-like form, but that isn’t always desired.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Without `without', `loopy' would try to initialize `a' to nil, which would
    ;; overwrite the value of 5 above.

    (let ((a 5))
      (loopy (without a)        ; Don't initialize `a'.
             (until (zerop a))  ; Leave loop when `a' equals 0.
             (collect a)        ; Collect the value of `a' into a list.
             (set a (1- a))))   ; Set `a' to the value of `(1- a)'.

    (let ((a 5))
      (loopy (no-init a)
             (while (not (zerop a)))
             (collect a)
             (set a (1- a))))
  #+end_src

#+findex: before
#+findex: before-do
#+findex: initially-do
#+findex: initially
- =before-do=, =before=, =initially-do=, =initially= :: Run Lisp expressions
  before the loop starts, after variables are initialized.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; = > (6 7 8)
    (loopy (with (a 1) (b 2))      ; Set `a' to 1 and `b' to 2.
           (before-do (cl-incf a)  ; Add 1 to `a'.
                      (cl-incf b)) ; Add 1 to `b'.
           (list i '(1 2 3))       ; Set `i' to each element in the list.
           (collect (+ i a b)))    ; Collect each sum into a list.

    ;; => (1 2 3)
    (loopy (with (a 1))
           ;; Message before the loop starts:
           (initially (message "Starting loop..."))
           (list i '(1 2 3))
           (collect i))
  #+end_src

#+findex: after-do
#+findex: after
#+findex: else-do
#+findex: else
- =after-do=, =after=, =else-do=, =else= :: Run Lisp expressions after the
  loop successfully completes.  This is similar to Python’s ~else~ statement
  following a ~for~ or ~while~ loop.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Messages that no odd number was found:
    ;; => nil
    (loopy (list i '(2 4 6 8))
           (when (cl-oddp i)
             (do (message "Odd number found."))
             (return t))                  ; Make the loop return `t'.
           (after-do
            (message "No odd number found.")
            ;; The macro already return `nil' by default,

           (when (cl-oddp i)
             (do (message "Odd number found."))
             (return t))
           (else (message "No odd number found.")))
  #+end_src

#+findex: finally-do
#+findex: finally
- =finally-do=, =finally= :: Run Lisp expressions after the loop exits, always.
  These expressions _do not_ affect the final return value of the loop.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (nil finally)
    (let (a b)
      (loopy (list i '(1 2 3 4 5 6))
             (when (> i 3) (leave))
             (after-do (setq a 'after))

      (list a b))

    ;; => nil
    (loopy (leave)
           ;; Doesn't affect return value:
           (finally-do 999))
  #+end_src

#+findex: finally-return
- =finally-return= :: Return a value, regardless of how the loop completes.
  These arguments override any explicit return values given in commands like
  =return= and =return-from=, as well as any implicit return values that can
  be created by accumulation commands.

  Specifying multiple values is the same as returning a list of those values.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => 999
    (loopy (return 1)
           (finally-return 999))

    ;; => (1 2)
    (loopy (leave) ; Leave to avoid infinite loop.
           (finally-return 1 2))
  #+end_src

#+findex: finally-protect
#+findex: finally-protected
- =finally-protect=, =finally-protected= :: Wrap the loop in ~unwind-protect~
  (not to be confused with ~condition-case~).  The arguments to this special
  macro argument (which are Lisp expressions) can access the variables used by
  the loop.

  Signaling an error will prevent the loop from returning a value.  This
  special macro argument does not prevent that error from being signaled, and
  is only meant to help avoid lingering effects that might arise from
  unplanned stops of the loop's execution.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Prints out the following, then continues signalling the error:
    ;;
    ;; Example var is: 1
    ;; Last used element in list is: 4
    ;; Then current value of ‘my-collection’: (1 2 3 4)
    (loopy (with (example-var 1))
           (list i '(1 2 3 4 5))
           (collect my-collection i)
           (when (> i 3)
             (do (signal 'some-error (list i))))
           (finally-protect
            (message "Example var is: %d" example-var)
            (message "Last used element in list is: %s" i)
            (message "Then current value of `my-collection': %s"
                     my-collection)))
  #+end_src

#+findex: flag
#+findex: flags
- =flag=, =flags= :: Options that change the behavior of ~loopy~ ([[#flags]]).
  For example, one can opt to use a different destructuring system, such as
  what is provided by the Dash library.  See that linked section for more
  information.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Use Dash for destructuring:
    ;;
    ;; (((1 2) (3 4)) (1 3) (2 4))
    (require 'loopy-dash)
    (loopy (flag dash)
           (list (whole &as a b) '((1 2) (3 4)))
           (collect wholes whole)
           (collect as a)
           (collect bs b)
           (finally-return wholes as bs))

    ;; Use Seq for destructuring:
    ;;
    ;; => (1 [2 3])
    (loopy (flag seq)
           (with ([a &rest b] [1 2 3]))
           (return a b))

    ;; Automatically split accumulations into separate variables:
    ;;
    ;; => ((1 3) (2 4))
    (loopy (flag split)
           (list (i j) '((1 2) (3 4)))
           (collect i)
           (collect j))
  #+end_src

#+findex: accum-opt
#+findex: opt-accum
- =accum-opt=, =opt-accum= :: Accumulation variables whose use should be
  optimized ([[#optimized-accums]]).  Implicit accumulation variables are always
  optimized, but explicit variables are unoptimized by default
  ([[#accumulation-commands]]).  This special macro argument allows optimizing named
  variables (with restrictions), which is useful when using more than one
  accumulation variable.  This is especially important for destructuring
  accumulations.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Multiple accumulation variables in `cl-loop':
    ;; => ((2 4) (1 3))
    (cl-loop for i in '(1 2 3 4)
             if (cl-evenp i) collect i into evens
             else collect i into odds
             finally return (list evens odds))

    ;; Faster code than above `cl-loop' (try `pp-macroexpand-last-sexp'):
    ;; => ((2 4) (1 3))
    (loopy (accum-opt evens odds)
           (list i '(1 2 3 4))
           (if (cl-evenp i)
               (collect evens i)
             (collect odds i))
           (finally-return evens odds))
  #+end_src


#+findex: wrap
- =wrap= :: A list of forms in which to wrap the loop itself (that is, not
  =before-do=, =after-do=, or anything else).  Each form can be either a list
  or a symbol.  If a list, the loop is inserted into the end of the list.  If
  a symbol, it is first converted to a list of 1 element before inserting the
  loop at the end of the list.  This special macro argument is similar in use
  to the Emacs Lisp macro ~thread-last~, except that forms listed first are
  applied last, as in normal Lisp code.

  The main difference between using this macro argument instead of just
  writing the function calls normally is that these forms can access variables
  initialized by the macro and that they occur after the code in =before-do=
  is run.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (loopy (wrap (let ((a 1)))
                 save-match-data)
           ...)

    ;; Similar to
    (let ((a 1))

As stated above, all other expressions will be considered loop commands
([[#loop-commands][Loop Commands]]).

#+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Note
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For convenience, the ~while~-loop that ~loopy~ creates is wrapped by a
~cl-block~.  Naming the loop names this block, which is created /after/
initializing variables.

The two special macro arguments =before-do= and =after-do= (and their aliases)
also occur within this ~cl-block~, before and after the loop, respectively.
This has 2 consequences:

1. Using ~cl-return~ in =before-do= will prevent the both loop and =after-do=
   code from running.

2. Using ~cl-return~ or an early exit command ([[#exiting-the-loop-early][Early Exit]]) in the loop will
   prevent the =after-do= code from running.  For this reason, =after-do= is
   run if and only if the loop completes successfully, hence the alias
   =else-do= and the similarity to Python's ~else~ statement when used with
   loops.

These three sections (=before-do=, =after-do=, and the ~while~-loop itself)
are the only structures that occur within the ~cl-block~.  Using ~cl-return~
in =before-do=, for example, will not stop code in =finally-do= from running
or values listed in =finally-return= from being returned.

* Loop Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: loop-commands
:DESCRIPTION: The main features of `loopy'.
:END:

#+cindex: loop command
If a macro argument does not match one of the previously listed special macro
arguments ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]), ~loopy~ will attempt to treat it as a loop
command.  Loop commands are only valid as a top-level argument to the macro, or
inside another loop command.

Therefore, these macro calls are valid:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect coll i)
         ;; Special macro argument:
         (finally-return coll))

  ;; Implicit accumulation variable and implicit return value:
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i))
#+END_SRC

and this is not:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (loopy (with (list i '(1 2 3)))
         (finally-return (collect coll i)))
#+END_SRC

Trying to use loop commands in places where they don't belong will result in
errors when the code is evaluated.

You should keep in mind that commands are evaluated in order.  This means that
attempting to do something like the below example might not do what you expect,
as =i= is assigned a value from the list after collecting =i= into =coll=.

#+caption: An example of how loop commands are evaluated in order.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; => (nil 1 2)
  (loopy (collect coll i)
         (list i '(1 2 3))
         (finally-return coll))
#+END_SRC

For convenience and understanding, the same command might have multiple names,
called {{{dfn(aliases)}}}.  For example, the command =set= has an alias =expr=,
because =set= is used to /set/ a variable to the value of an /expression/.
Similary, the =array= command has the alias =string=, because the =array=
command can be used to iterate through the elements of an array or string[fn:1].
You can define custom aliases using the macro ~loopy-defalias~ ([[#custom-aliases][Custom Aliases]]).

Similar to other libraries, many commands have an alias of the present
participle form (the "-ing" form).  A few examples are seen in the table below.

| Command   | "-ing" Alias |
|-----------+--------------|
| =set=     | =setting=    |
| =list=    | =listing=    |
| =collect= | =collecting= |
| =numbers= | =numbering=  |

Some commands take optional keyword arguments.  For example, the command =list=
can take a function argument following the keyword =:by=, which affects how that
iterates through the elements in the list.

For simplicity, the commands are described using the following notation:

- If a command has multiple names, the names are separated by a vertical bar,
  such as in =set|expr=.
- =VAR= is an unquoted symbol that will be used as a variable name, such as =i=
  in =(list i my-list)=.
- =FUNC= is a quoted Lisp function name, such as ~#'my-func~ or ~'my-func~, a
  variable whose value is a function, or a ~lambda~ expression.
- =NAME= is an unquoted name of a loop (or, more accurately, of a =cl-block=).
- =EXPR= is a single Lisp expression, such as =(+ 1 2)=, ='(1 2 3)=, =my-var=,
  or =(some-function my-var)=.  =EXPRS= means multiple expressions.  Really, we
  are concerned with the value of the expression, not the expression itself.
- =CMD= is a loop command, as opposed to a normal Lisp expression.
  =(list i '(1 2 3))=, =(cycle 5)=, and =(return-from outer-loop 7)=
  are examples of loop commands.  =CMDS= means multiple commands.
- Optional arguments are surround by brackets.  =[EXPR]= is an optional
  expression, and =[CMD]= is an optional command.  By extension, =[EXPRS]= is
  equivalent to =[EXPR [EXPR [...]]]=, and =[CMDS]= to =[CMD [CMD [...]]]=.
- Optional keyword arguments are shown as =&key key1 key2 ...=, where =key1=,
  =key2=, and so on are the literal keywords.  Just like in normal Lisp
  functions, command keywords must be prefixed by a colon (":").  For example,
  the iteration command =list= has a keyword argument =by=, which can be given a
  value using =:by SOME-EXPRESSION=.


Generally, =VAR= is initialized to ~nil~, but not always.  This document tries
to note when that is not the case.

** Basic Destructuring
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: basic-destructuring
:DESCRIPTION: How to destructure variables and values in loop commands.
:END:

#+cindex: variable destructuring
Similar to features like ~seq-let~, ~cl-destructuring-bind~, and ~pcase-let~,
~loopy~ is capable of destructuring values when assigning values to variables.
Destructuring in Loopy is similar to, but more featureful than, what is
provided in =cl-lib=.

Some differences include:
- Destructuring arrays
- Destructuring in accumulation commands ([[#accumulation-commands]])
- Destructuring in commands iterating through ~setf~-able places in a sequence
  ([[#sequence-reference-iteration]])

In addition to what can be done in loop commands, several macros are available
for using Loopy's destructuring outside of ~loopy~ loops ([[#destr-macros]]).

This section describes the basic built-in destructuring used by most loop
commands, such as =set= and =list=.  Destructuring in accumulation commands and
sequence reference commands works slightly differently, and is described more in
those sections.

The last thing to note is that ~loopy~ loops can be made to use alternative
destructuring systems, such as ~seq-let~ or ~pcase-let~.  This is done by using
the =flag= special macro argument ([[#flags]]).  If you are familiar with the
package =dash= [fn:dash] and its Clojure-style destructuring, consider trying
the flag =dash= provided by the package =loopy-dash=.

Below are two examples of destructuring in ~cl-loop~ and ~loopy~.

#+caption: Destructuring values in a list.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (cl-loop for (i . j) in '((1 . 2) (3 . 4))
           collect i
           collect j)

  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (loopy (list (i . j) '((1 . 2) (3 . 4)))
         (collect i)
         (collect j))
#+end_src

#+caption: Destructuring values in assignment.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (cl-loop for elem in '((1 . 2) (3 . 4))
           for (i . j) = elem
           collect i
           collect j)

  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (loopy (list elem '((1 . 2) (3 . 4)))
         (set (i . j) elem)
         (collect i)
         (collect j))
#+end_src


You can use destructured assignment by passing an unquoted sequence of symbols
as the =VAR= argument of a loop command.  Loopy supports destructuring lists and
arrays (which includes strings and vectors).
- To destructure lists, use a list.
- To destructure arrays, use a vector.

This sequence of symbols can be shorter than the destructured sequence, /but not
longer/.  If shorter, the unassigned elements of the list are simply ignored.

An element in the sequence =VAR= can be one of the following:

- A positional variable which will be bound to the corresponding element in the
  sequence.  These variables can themselves be sequences, but must be of the
  correct type.  Unlike ~seq-let~, Loopy does not currently have a generic
  syntax for sequences.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
    (loopy (list [i (j k)] '([1 (2 3)] [4 (5 6)]))
           (collect (list i j k)))
  #+end_src

- The symbol =_=: The symbol =_= means to avoid creating a variable.  This can
  be more efficient.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Only create the variables `a' and `c'.
    ;; => ((1 3) (4 6))
    (loopy (list (a _ c) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
           (collect (list a c)))

    ;; These two destructurings do the same thing,
    ;; and only bind the variable `a':
    ;; => (1 3)
    (loopy (array (a) [(1 2) (3 4)])
           (collect a))

    ;; => (1 3)
    (loopy (array (a . _) [(1 2) (3 4)])
           (collect a))
  #+end_src

- The symbol =&whole=: If =&whole= is the first element in the sequence, then
  the second element of the sequence names a variable that holds the entire
  value of what is destructured.

  This is the same as when used in a CL ~lambda~ list.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; See that the variable `both' holds the value of the entire
    ;; list element:
    ;; => (((1 2) 1 2)
    ;;     ((3 4) 3 4))
    (loopy (list (&whole both i j)  '((1 2) (3 4)))
           (collect (list both i j)))

    (mapcar (cl-function (lambda ((&whole both i j))
                           (list both i j)))
            '((1 2) (3 4)))
  #+end_src

- The symbol =&rest=: A variable named after =&rest= contains the remaining
  elements of the destructured value.  When destructuring lists, one can also
  instead use dotted notation.  These variables can themselves be sequences.

  This is the same as when used in ~seq-let~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((1 [2 3]) (4 [5 6]))
    (loopy (list [i &rest j] '([1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
           (collect (list i j)))

    ;; => ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
    (loopy (list [i &rest [j k]] '([1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
           (collect (list i j k)))

    ;; => ((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6)))
    (loopy (list (i . j) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
           (collect (list i j)))

    ;; Works the same as above:
    (loopy (list (i &rest j) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
           (collect (list i j)))

    ;; The above using `seq-let':
    (let ((result))
      (dolist (elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
        (seq-let [i &rest j] elem
          (push (list i j) result)))
      (reverse result))
  #+end_src

- The symbol =&key= or =&keys=: Variables named after =&key= are transformed
  into keys whose values will be sought using ~plist-get~, which returns ~nil~
  if the key isn't found in the list.

  Currently, only lists support this destructuring.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((1 2 nil) (4 5 nil))
    (loopy (list (&key a b missing) '((:b 2 :c 3 :a 1)
                                      (:a 4 :b 5 :c 6)))
           (collect (list a b missing)))
  #+end_src

  If the key is not in the list, a default value can be provided by using a
  two-item list of the variable and the default value.  If a default value is
  provided, then keys are sought using ~plist-member~ so that a value of ~nil~
  for a key is not the same as a missing key.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Note that `nil' is not the same as a missing value.
    ;; => ((1 2 nil 25) (4 5 24 25))
    (loopy (list (&key a b (c 24) (missing 25)) '((:b 2 :c nil :a 1)
                                                  (:a 4 :b 5)))
           (collect (list a b c missing)))
  #+end_src

  Keys are sought in values after those bound to positional variables, which can
  be the same values bound to the variable named by =&rest= when both are
  used.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Keys are only sought after positional variables:
    ;; => ((1 2 :k1 'ignored 3))
    (loopy (array (a b c d &key k1) [(1 2 :k1 'ignored :k1 3)])
           (collect (list a b c d k1)))

    ;; If `&rest' is used, keys are sought only in that variable:
    ;; => ((1 (:k1 3) 3))
    (loopy (array (a &rest b &key k1) [(1 :k1 3)])
           (collect (list a b k1)))
  #+end_src

  =&key= and =&rest= can be used in any order, but =&key= must come before
  the dot in dotted lists.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((1 (:k1 3) 3))
    (loopy (array (a &rest b &key k1) [(1 :k1 3)])
           (collect (list a b k1)))

    (loopy (array (a &key k1 &rest b) [(1 :k1 3)])
           (collect (list a b k1)))

    (loopy (array (a &key k1 . b) [(1 :k1 3)])
           (collect (list a b k1)))

  also be achieved by specifying a value using the =with= special macro
  argument.  When destructuring, each variable is initialized to =INIT=, not
  a destructured part of =INIT=.

  This command also has the aliases =setting= and =exprs=.

  #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Note
  #+begin_quote
  =set= does /not/ behave the same as ~setq~ in all situations.

  While =set= can take multiple arguments, it only assigns the value of one
  expression to one variable during each iteration of the loop (unless using
  destructuring).  It does not take pairs of variables and values in the same
  way that ~setq~ does.

  Furthermore, variables assigned by =set= (and other commands) are by
  default ~let~-bound around the loop and generally initialized to ~nil~.
  This means that doing =(set VAR EXPR)= will not, by default, affect
  variables outside of the loop in the same way that using =(do (setq VAR
  EXPR))= would.

** Iteration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: iteration-and-looping-commands
:DESCRIPTION: Iterating through sequences, etc.

Iteration commands bind local variables and determine when the loop ends.  If no
command sets an ending condition, then the loop runs forever.  Infinite loops
can be exited by using early-exit commands ([[#exiting-the-loop-early]]) or boolean
commands ([[#boolean-commands]]).

Iteration commands must occur in the top level of the ~loopy~ form or in a
sub-loop command ([[#sub-loops]]).  Trying to do something like the below will
signal an error.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

In ~loopy~, iteration commands are named after what they iterate through.  For

  This command also has the aliases =num=, =number=, and =numbering=.

  The command =numbers= is used to iterate through numbers.  For example,
  =(numbers i :from 1 :to 10)= is similar to =(list i (number-sequence 1 10))=,
  and =(numbers i 3)= is similar to =(set i 3 (1+ i))=.

  To balance convenience and similarity to other commands, =numbers= has a
  flexible argument list.  In its most basic form, it uses no keywords and takes
  a starting value and an ending value.  The ending value is inclusive.

  To specify the step size, one can use an optional third argument (like in
  Python's ~range~) or the keyword =:by= (like in ~cl-loop~).  The value of the
  optional third argument can be positive or negative. /However/, in keeping
  with ~cl-loop~, the value for =:by= should always be positive; other keyword
  arguments then control whether the variable is incremented or decremented.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (loopy (numbers i :from 1 :to 5 :by 1.5)
           (collect i))
  #+end_src

  By default, the variable's value starts at 0 and increases by 1.  To specify
  whether the value should be increasing or decreasing when using the =:by=
  keyword, one can use the keywords =:downfrom=, =:downto=, =:upfrom=, and
  =:upto=.  The keywords =:from= and =:to= don't by themselves specify a
  direction.

  To specify an /exclusive/ ending value, use the keywords =:below= for
  increasing values and =:above= for decreasing values.

If you prefer using positional arguments to keyword arguments, you can use the
commands =numbers-up= and =numbers-down= to specify directions.  These commands
are simple wrappers of the above =numbers= command.

#+findix: nums-down

#+findex: numbering-down
- =(numbers-down|nums-down VAR START [END] &key by)= :: Equivalent to =(numbers

  This command also has the aliases =numsdown= and =numbering-down=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (10 8 6 4 2)
    (loopy (numbers-down i 10 1 :by 2)

#+findex: numbering-up
- =(numbers-up|nums-up VAR START [END] &key by)= :: Equivalent to =(numbers VAR

*** Sequence Iteration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sequence-iteration
:DESCRIPTION: Iterating through sequences.
:END:

These commands provide various ways to iterate through sequences
([[info:elisp#Sequences Arrays Vectors]]).

#+cindex: sequence element distribution
Instead of iterating through just one sequence, the =array=, =list=, and =seq=
commands can be given multiple sequences of various sizes.  In such cases, the
elements of the sequences are {{{dfn(distributed)}}}, like in the distributive
property from mathematics.  A new sequence of distributed elements is created
before the loop runs, and that sequence is used for iteration instead of the
source sequences.  As seen in the below example, the resulting behavior is
similar to that of nested loops.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((1 3 6) (1 4 6) (1 5 6) (2 3 6) (2 4 6) (2 5 6))
  (loopy (list i '(1 2) '(3 4 5) '(6))
         (collect i))

  ;; Gives the same result as this
  (let ((result nil))
    (dolist (i '(1 2))
      (dolist (j '(3 4 5))
        (dolist (k '(6))
          (push (list i j k) result))))
    (nreverse result))

  ;; and this
  (cl-loop for i in '(1 2)
           append (cl-loop for j in '(3 4 5)
                           append (cl-loop for k in '(6)
                                           collect (list i j k))))
#+end_src


The =array= and =sequence= commands can use the same keywords as the =numbers=
command ([[#numeric-iteration]]) for working with the index and choosing a range of
the sequence elements through which to iterate.  In addition to those keywords,
they also have an =index= keyword, which names the variable used to store the
accessed index during the loop.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((1 . 9) (3 . 6) (5 . 5) (7 . 3) (9 . 1))
  (loopy (array i [10 9 8 6 7 5 4 3 2 1] :from 1 :by 2 :index ind)
         (collect (cons ind i)))
#+end_src

Keep in mind that if used with sequence distribution, these keywords affect
iterating through the sequence of distributed elements.  That is, they do not
affect how said sequence is produced.  In the example below, see that ~cddr~ is
applied to the sequence of distributed elements.  It is /not/ applied to the
source sequences.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; This code creates the sequence of distributed elements
  ;; ((1 4) (1 5) (1 6) (2 4) (2 5) (2 6) (3 4) (3 5) (3 6))
  ;; and then moves through this sequence using `cddr'.
  ;;
  ;; => ((1 4) (1 6) (2 5) (3 4) (3 6))
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) :by #'cddr)
         (collect i))

  ;; Not the same as:
  ;; => ((1 4) (1 6) (3 4) (3 6))
  (loopy (list i '(1 3) '(4 6))
         (collect i))
#+end_src


#+findex: array
#+findex: string
#+findex: arraying
#+findex: stringing
- =(array|string VAR EXPR [EXPRS] &key KEYS)= :: Loop through the
  elements of the array =EXPR=.  In Emacs Lisp, strings are arrays whose
  elements are characters.

  This command also has the aliases =arraying= and =stringing=.

  =KEYS= is one or several of =from=, =upfrom=, =downfrom=, =to=, =upto=,
  =downto=, =above=, =below=, =by=, and =index=.  =index= names the variable
  used to store the index being accessed.  For others, see the =numbers= command.

  If multiple arrays are given, then the elements of these arrays are
  distributed into an array of lists.  In that case, the above keywords apply to
  this new, resulting array of lists.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

- =(list|each VAR EXPR [EXPRS] &key by)= :: Loop through each element of the

  This command also has the alias =listing=.

  If multiple lists are given, distribute the elements of the lists into one new
  list.  In such cases, =by= applies to the new list, not the arguments of the
  command.

#+findex: map
#+findex: map-pairs
#+findex: mapping
#+findex: mapping-pairs
- =(map|map-pairs VAR EXPR &key unique)= :: Iterate through the dotted key-value
  pairs of map =EXPR=, using the function ~map-pairs~ from the =map.el= library.
  This library generalizes working with association lists ("alists"), property
  lists ("plists"), hash-tables, and vectors.

  This command also has the aliases =mapping= and =mapping-pairs=.

  In each dotted pair assigned to =VAR=, the ~car~ is the key and the ~cdr~ is
  the value.

  By default, only the unique keys are used.  To disable this deduplication,
  pass ~nil~ to the =unique= keyword argument.

  In general, as a map in not necessarily a sequence, you should not rely on the
  order in which the key-value pairs are found.  There is no guarantee that they
  be in the same order each time.

  These pairs are created before the loop begins.  In other words, the map
  =EXPR= is not processed progressively, but all at once.  Therefore, this
  command can have a noticeable start-up cost when working with very large maps.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((a . 1) (b . 2))
    (loopy (map pair '((a . 1) (b . 2)))
           (collect pair))

    ;; => ((a b) (1 2))
    (loopy (map (key . value) '((a . 1) (b . 2)))
           (collect keys key)
           (collect values value)

           (collect keys key)
           (collect values value)
           (finally-return keys values))

    ;; NOTE: For vectors, the keys are indices.
    ;; => ((0 1) (1 2))
    (loopy (map (key . value) [1 2])
           (collect keys key)
           (collect values value)
           (finally-return keys values))

    ;; => ((a b) (1 2))
    (let ((my-table (make-hash-table)))
      (puthash 'a 1 my-table)
      (puthash 'b 2 my-table)

      (loopy (map (key . value) my-table)
             (collect keys key)
             (collect values value)
             (finally-return keys values)))
  #+end_src

  Depending on how a map is created, a map might repeat a key multiple times.
  Currently, the function ~map-pairs~ returns such keys.  By default, the
  ~loopy~ command =map-pairs= ignores such duplicate keys.  This is for two
  reasons:
  1. This is more consistent with the command =map-ref=, for which such
     duplicates are more likely to cause errors.
  2. For maps that can have duplicate keys (such as alists and plists), there
     are already other iteration commands (such as =list= and =cons=) that
     explicitly include the duplicates.

  Again, this can be disabled by setting =unique= to nil.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; A comparison of setting the `unique' key to nil:
    ;;
    ;; => ((a 1) (a 2) (b 3))
    (loopy (map (key . val) '((a . 1) (a . 2) (b . 3)) :unique nil)
           (collect (list key val)))

    ;; In this case, `list' has the same result:
    ;; => ((a 1) (a 2) (b 3))
    (loopy (list (key . val) '((a . 1) (a . 2) (b . 3)))
           (collect (list key val)))

    ;; => ((:a 1) (:a 2) (:b 3))
    (loopy (map (key . val) '(:a 1 :a 2 :b 3) :unique nil)
           (collect (list key val)))

    ;; In this case, `cons' has the same result:
    ;; => ((:a 1) (:a 2) (:b 3))
    (loopy (cons (key val) '(:a 1 :a 2 :b 3) :by #'cddr)
           (collect (list key val)))
  #+end_src

#+findex: seq
#+findex: sequence

- =(sequence|seq VAR EXPR [EXPRS] &key KEYS)= :: Loop through the sequence
  =EXPR=, binding =VAR= to the elements of the sequence (see [[info:elisp#Sequences Arrays Vectors][elisp#Sequences
  Arrays Vectors]]).  This is a more generic form of the commands =list= and
  =array=, though it is somewhat less efficient.  These sequences should not be
  confused with those generic sequences as understood by the library =seq.el=.

  This command also has the aliases =seqing= and =sequencing=.

  =KEYS= is one or several of =from=, =upfrom=, =downfrom=, =to=, =upto=,
  =downto=, =above=, =below=, =by=, and =index=.  =index= names the variable
  used to store the index being accessed.  For others, see the =numbers= command.

  If multiple sequences are given, then these keyword arguments apply to the
  resulting sequence of distributed elements.

*** Sequence Index Iteration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sequence-index-iteration
:DESCRIPTION: Iterating through indices without accessing values.
:END:

This command is for iterating through a sequence's indices without accessing
the actual values of that sequence.  This is helpful if you know ahead of
time that you are only interested in a small subset of the sequence's
elements.

As with the =array= and =seq= commands, the =seq-index= command can use the
same keywords as the =numbers= command ([[#numeric-iteration]]) for working with
the index and choosing a range of the sequence elements through which to
iterate.

#+findex: seq-index
#+findex: seqi
#+findex: seqing-index
#+findex: sequencing-index

#+findex: listi
#+findex: string-index
#+findex: stringing-index
#+findex: stringi
- =(seq-index VAR EXPR &key KEYS)= :: Iterate through the indices of =EXPR=.

  There is only one implementation of this command; there are no
  type-specific versions.  This command also has the following aliases:
  - =array-index=, =arraying-index=, =arrayi=
  - =list-index=, =listing-index=, =listi=
  - =string-index=, =stringing-index=, =stringi=
  - =sequence-index=, =sequenceing-index=, =sequencei=, =seqi=, =seqing-index=

  The aliases =seqi=, =arrayi=, =listi=, and =stringi= are similar to the
  aliases =seqf=, =arrayf=, =listf=, and =stringf= of the =seq-ref= command.

  =KEYS= is one or several of =from=, =upfrom=, =downfrom=, =to=, =upto=,
  =downto=, =above=, =below=, and =by=.  For their meaning, see the =numbers=
  command.  This command is very similar to =numbers=, except that it can
  automatically end the loop when the final element is reached.  With
  =numbers=, one would first need to explicitly calculate the length of the
  sequence.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (97 98 99 100 101 102)
    (loopy (with (my-string "abcdef"))
           (string-index idx my-string)
           (collect (aref my-string idx)))

    ;; Works the same as
    (loopy (with (my-string "abcdef"))
           (numbers idx :from 0 :below (length my-string))
           (collect (aref my-string idx)))
  #+end_src

  This command does not support destructuring.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (0 1 2)
    (loopy (seq-index i [1 2 3])
           (collect i))

    ;; => (0 1 2)
    (loopy (array-index i "abc")
           (collect i))

    ;; => (0 1 2)
    (loopy (list-index i '(1 2 3))
           (collect i))

    ;; => (8 6 4 2)
    (loopy (with (my-seq [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]))
           (seq-index idx my-seq :from 8 :downto 1 :by 2)
           (collect (elt my-seq idx)))
  #+end_src

*** Sequence Reference Iteration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sequence-reference-iteration
:DESCRIPTION: Iterating through places/fields in sequences.
:END:

These commands all iterate through ~setf~-able places as generalized
variables ([[info:elisp#Generalized Variables]]).  These generalized variables
are commonly called "references", "fields", or "places".  The below example
demonstrates using ~(nth 1 my-list)~ and ~(aref my-array 1)~ as ~setf~-able
places.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (1 99 3 4 5)
  (let ((my-list '(1 2 3 4 5)))
    (setf (nth 1 my-list) 99)
    my-list)

  ;; => [(1 2 3) (4 . 99)]
  (let ((my-array [(1 2 3) (4 5 6)]))
    (setf (cdr (aref my-array 1)) 99)
    my-array)
#+end_src

Like other commands, "field" or "reference" commands can also use
destructuring, in which case the fields/places of the sequence are
destructured into "sub-fields", like the ~cdr~ of the second array element
in the example above.

#+attr_texinfo: :tag Caution
#+begin_quote
Be aware that using ~setf~ on an array sub-sequence named by =&rest=
will only overwrite values, not truncate or grow the array.
#+end_quote

#+attr_texinfo: :tag Warning
#+begin_quote
Unfortunately, not all kinds of recursive destructuring work on references.
This is a limitation of how generic setters are implemented, and is not
specific to ~loopy~.

Currently, the variable after =&rest= in arrays cannot be recursive.
#+end_quote

As with the =array= and =seq= commands, the =array-ref= and =seq-ref=
commands can use the same keywords as the =numbers= command
([[#numeric-iteration]]) for working with the index and choosing a range of the
sequence elements through which to iterate.  In addition to those keywords,
they also have an =index= keyword, which names the variable used to store
the accessed index during the loop.

** Accumulation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: accumulation-commands
:DESCRIPTION: Accumulating values into new sequences, aggregating values, etc.
:END:

Accumulation commands are used to accumulate or aggregate values into a
variable, such as creating a list of values or summing the elements in a
sequence.

If needed, you can refer to the same accumulation variable in multiple
accumulation commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (1 6 2 7 3 8)
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect coll i)
         (collect coll (+ i 5))
         (finally-return coll))
#+end_src

#+attr_texinfo: :tag Note
#+begin_quote
Keep in mind that it is an error to modify accumulation variables outside of
accumulation commands.  This restriction allows accumulations to be much faster.
#+end_quote

Like with other loop commands, variables created by accumulation commands (such
as =coll= in the above example) are initialized to ~nil~ unless stated
otherwise.  When otherwise, such as for the commands =sum= and =multiply=, the
initial value of a variable depends on the first accumulation command using that
variable in the arguments given to the macro.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => 27
  (loopy (numbers i :from 1 :to 3)
         (sum my-accum i) ; Starts at 0.
         (multiply my-accum i)
         (finally-return my-accum))

  ;; => 21
  (loopy (numbers i  1 3)
         (multiply my-accum i) ; Starts at 1.
         (sum my-accum i)
         (finally-return my-accum))
#+end_src

#+cindex: accumulation destructuring
Similar to iteration commands, accumulation commands can also use destructuring.
In accumulation commands, the values resulting from destructuring are
accumulated, instead of the destructured value.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
  (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
         (collect (coll1 coll2 coll3) elem)
         (finally-return coll1 coll2 coll3))

  ;; => (5 7 9)
  (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
         (sum (sum1 sum2 sum3) elem)
         (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3))

  ;; Returns the same values as above.
  (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
         (set sum1 (cl-first elem)  (+ sum1 (cl-first elem)))
         (set sum2 (cl-second elem) (+ sum2 (cl-second elem)))
         (set sum3 (cl-third elem)  (+ sum3 (cl-third elem)))
         (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3))
#+end_src


#+cindex: implied accumulation results
Like in ~cl-loop~, you do not need to supply a variable name to accumulation
commands.  If no accumulation variable is given, then the accumulated value is
understood to be the return value of the loop.  These implied return values can
be overridden by using the the =return= and =return-from= loop commands or the
=finally-return= macro argument.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (cl-loop for i from 1 to 3 collect i)

  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy (numbers i :from 1 :to 3) (collect i))
#+end_src

#+vindex: loopy-result
Unlike in ~cl-loop~, this implied return value is bound to the variable
~loopy-result~ after the loop completes, even when the loop is left early.  This
variable can be used in the =after-do=, =finally-do=, and =finally-return=
special macro arguments.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (0 1 2 3 4 5)
  (loopy (numbers i :from 1 :to 10)
         (when (> i 5) (leave))
         (collect i)
         (finally-return (cons 0 loopy-result)))
#+end_src

In general, you should not attempt to modify or use the value of ~loopy-result~
during the loop, as it is not guaranteed to have a correct value when
efficiently building sequences.  For example, it is often faster to build a list
in reverse instead of appending to its end.  For some commands, such as those in
[[#accum-numeric]] and [[#accum-generic]], this does not matter.

Be aware that explicitly named accumulation variables do not affect the implied
return value of a loop.  Such values must be returned explicitly, or they will
be ignored when the macro returns a value.  This limitation is needed for more
consistently handling the complexity that comes from allowing unknown kinds of
destructuring via the alternative destructuring systems.  This may change in the
future.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; See how the variable `my-explicit-variable' is ignored when
  ;; returning a final value:
  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i)
         (collect my-explicit-variable (* 2 i)))
#+end_src

Therefore, when mixing implicit and explicit accumulation variables, you must
use the =finally-return= special macro argument to return all of the
accumulation results.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((1 2 3)  ; loopy-result
  ;;     (2 4 6)  ; my-other-collection
  ;;     (1 2 3)  ; car-coll
  ;;     (2 4 6)) ; cdr-coll
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i)
         (set j (* 2 i))
         (collect my-other-collection j)
         (collect (car-coll . cdr-coll) (cons i j))
         (finally-return loopy-result
                         my-other-collection
                         car-coll cdr-coll))
#+end_src

#+cindex: accumulation compatibility
Like in ~cl-loop~, when using implied variables, multiple accumulation commands
will use the same variable (~loopy-result~).  For _all_ accumulation variables
used by multiple accumulation commands, you should make sure that the commands
are actually compatible.  If not, then ~loopy~ will raise an error.

For example, you should not try to accumulate =collect= results and =sum=
results into the same variable, as one cannot use a list as a number.  On the
other hand, =sum= and =multiply= are compatible, since they both act on numbers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Incompatible commands:
  ;; => ERROR
  (loopy (numbers i :from 1 :to 3)
         (collect i)
         (sum i))

  ;; Compatible commands:
  ;; => 27
  (loopy (numbers i :from 1 :to 3)
         (sum i)
         (multiply i))
#+end_src


By default, one must specify separate accumulation variables to be able to
accumulate into separate values.  This can make accumulation slower, because
~loopy~ ensures that named accumulation variables (excluding the previously
mentioned ~loopy-result~) have the correct value during the loop.  For example,
~loopy~ will construct named accumulation variables containing lists in the
correct order, instead of using the more efficient ~push~-~nreverse~ idiom.
This behavior can be disabled by optimizing accumulations using the =accum-opt=
special macro argument ([[#optimized-accums]]).

Below are examples of an optimized accumulation and an un-optimized
accumulation.  See that the example expansion of the un-optimized accumulation
is more complex and uses a slower way of building the accumulated list.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Optimized accumulation:
  ;; => (1 3 2 6 3 9)
  (loopy (accum-opt coll)
         (numbers i :from 1 :to 3)
         (collect coll i)
         (collect coll (* i 3))
         (finally-return coll))

  ;; Optimized example expansion:
  (let* ((coll nil)
         (i 1)
         (nums-end192 3)
         (nums-increment191 1))
    (cl-block nil
      (while (<= i nums-end192)
        (setq coll (cons i coll))
        (setq coll (cons (* i 3) coll))
        (setq i (1+ i)))
      (setq coll (nreverse coll)))
    coll)
#+end_src


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Unoptimized accumulation:
  ;; => (1 3 2 6 3 9)

         (finally-return coll))

  ;; Unoptimized example expansion:
  (let* ((coll nil)
         (coll-last-link-190 coll)

         (nums-increment188 1))
    (cl-block nil
      (while (<= i nums-end189)
        (cond
         (coll-last-link-190
          (setcdr coll-last-link-190 (list i))
          (setq coll-last-link-190 (cdr coll-last-link-190)))
         (coll
          (setq coll-last-link-190 (last coll))
          (setcdr coll-last-link-190 (list i))

         (t
          (setq coll (list i)

        (cond

          (setcdr coll-last-link-190 (list (* i 3)))
          (setq coll-last-link-190 (cdr coll-last-link-190)))
         (coll
          (setq coll-last-link-190 (last coll))
          (setcdr coll-last-link-190 (list (* i 3)))
          (setq coll-last-link-190 (cdr coll-last-link-190)))
         (t

                coll-last-link-190 coll)))
        (setq i (1+ i))))
    coll)
#+end_src

#+attr_texinfo: :tag Warning
#+begin_quote
You should not try to access implied (or optimized) accumulation results (for
example, ~loopy-result~) while the loop is running.  Implied results are only
required to be correct after the loop ends (before code in =else-do= is run),
allowing for more efficient code.

Furthermore, because using a =return= or =return-from= command overrides implied
return values, using these commands can prevent implied accumulation results
from being finalized.  Using the =leave= command, which exits the loop without
returning a value, does not affect the correctness of implied results.
#+end_quote

#+cindex: split vs. accum-opt
Instead of explicitly optimizing accumulation variables, another approach is to
use the =split= flag ([[#flags]]), which behaves like a more limited version of the
=accum-opt= special macro argument.  When enabled, every accumulation command
with an implied accumulation variable will use a separate variable.  When the
loop ends, the values of these separate variables are gathered in the variable
~loopy-result~, in the order that their respective commands appeared in the
macro's arguments.  In the example below, note that the result of ~(collect i)~
is the first element of ~loopy-result~, even though the collection happens
/after/ the first summation when the loop runs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((2 4) 15)
  (loopy (flag split)
         (numbers i :from 1 :to 5)
         (when (cl-evenp i)
           (collect i))
         (sum i)
         ;; NOTE: This `finally-return' isn't needed, as `loopy-result'
         ;; is already the implied return value.
         (finally-return loopy-result))

  ;; Using `accum-opt':
  ;; => ((2 4) 15)
  (loopy (accum-opt coll sum)
         (numbers i :from 1 :to 5)
         (when (cl-evenp i)
           (collect coll i))
         (sum sum i)
         (finally-return coll sum))
#+end_src

*** Common Properties of Accumulation Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:END:

You will notice that each accumulation command has an alias of the command name
in the present participle form (the "-ing" form).  For example, instead of
"minimize", you can use "minimizing".  Instead of "sum" and "append", you can
use "summing" and "appending".  This is similar to the behavior of ~cl-loop~,
and helps to avoid name collisions when using the ~loopy-iter~ macro ([[#loopy-iter][The
~loopy-iter~ Macro]]).

#+cindex: accumulation keyword arguments
Some accumulation commands have optional keyword parameters, which are listed
in the command's definition.  To avoid repetition, the common parameters are
all described below.

#+cindex: accumulation keyword at
- =at= :: Where to place a value.  One of =end=, =start=, or =beginning=
  (equivalent to =start=).  If ungiven, defaults to =end=.  These positions
  need not be quoted.

#+cindex: accumulation keyword into
- =into= :: An alternative way to specify the variable into which to
  accumulate values.  One would normally just give =VAR= as the first
  argument of the loop command, but if you wish, you can use this keyword
  argument for a more ~cl-loop~-like syntax.

  As all accumulation commands support this keyword, it is not listed in
  any command definition.

#+cindex: accumulation keyword test
- =test= :: A function of two arguments, usually used to test for equality.
  Most tests default to ~equal~, like in other Emacs Lisp libraries.  This is
  different from ~cl-lib~, which mimics Common Lisp and prefers using ~eql~.

#+cindex: accumulation keyword key
- =key= :: A function of one argument, used to transform the inputs of
  =test=.

#+cindex: accumulation keyword init
- =init= :: The initial value of =VAR=.  For explicitly named variables, one
  can use this argument or the =with= special macro argument.  When using the
  =split= flag, this argument is the only way to specify a non-default
  initial value.

#+cindex: accumulation keyword result-type
- =result-type= :: A sequence type into which =VAR= is converted /after the
  loop is over/.  These types need not be quoted.  For example, ='vector= and
  =vector= are both valid ways to specify the vector data type.  Commands using
  the same variable must use the same type coercion.

  This argument can be more convenient than writing out a call to ~cl-coerce~
  or ~seq-into~.

The arguments to the =test= and =key= parameters can be quoted functions or
variables, just like when using ~cl-union~, ~cl-adjoin~, and so on.  ~loopy~
knows how to expand efficiently for either case.

*** Generic Accumulation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: accum-generic
:DESCRIPTION: Accumulating function output.
:END:

Generic accumulation commands accumulate the output of functions that receive
the accumulation variable.  They are very similar to updating a variable's value
using the =set= command.

#+findex: set-accum
#+findex: setting-accum
- =(set-accum VAR EXPR &key init)= :: Set the accumulation variable =VAR= to the
  value of =EXPR=.  =init= sets the initial value of =VAR=, which defaults to
  ~nil~.

  This command also has the alias =setting-accum=.

  This command is a basic wrapper around =set= for only one value.  Because this
  command cannot be optimized (as it does not construct a sequence), it is safe
  to access the implicit variable ~loopy-result~ in =EXPR=, so long as the
  variable is not being modified by another command for which that would be
  unsafe.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => 16
    (loopy (array i [1 2 3])

    ;; These are equivalent:

    ;; => 16
    (loopy (array i [1 2 3])
           (set-accum my-sum (+ my-sum i) :init 10)
           (finally-return my-sum))

    ;; => 16
    (loopy (array i [1 2 3])

#+findex: accumulate
#+findex: accumulating
- =(accumulate|accumulating VAR EXPR FUNC &key init)= :: Accumulate the result
  of applying function =FUNC= to =EXPR= and =VAR=.  =EXPR= and =VAR= are used as
  the first and second arguments to =FUNC=, respectively.

  This is a generic accumulation command in case the others don't meet your
  needs.  It is similar in effect to using the command =expr=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Call `(cons i my-accum)'
    ;;
    ;; => (2 1)
    (loopy (list i '(1 2))
           (accumulate my-accum i #'cons :init nil)
           (finally-return my-accum))

    ;; Works mostly the same as the above:
    (loopy (list i '(1 2))
           (set my-accum (cons i my-accum))
           (finally-return my-accum))

    ;; => ((3 1) (4 2))

           (accumulate (accum1 accum2) i #'cons :init nil)
           (finally-return accum1 accum2))
  #+end_src

  This command also has the alias =callf2=.  It is similar to using the function
  ~cl-callf2~, except that the function argument is given last and must be
  quoted.  This alias is intended to help users remember argument order.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

***  Optimizing Accumulations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: optimized-accums
:DESCRIPTION: Producing efficient accumulations.
:END:

#+cindex: optimizing accumulations
By default, named accumulation variables (excluding the automatically named
~loopy-result~) are accessible during the loop, and their values are always
correct during execution.  For example, lists are always in the correct order,
even when constructing linked lists in the reverse order would be more
efficient.

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; Note how `coll' is always in the correct order:
  ;; => ((1 2 3)
  ;;     ((1) (1 2) (1 2 3)))
  (loopy (array i [1 2 3])
         (collect coll i)
         (collect intermediate-values (copy-sequence coll))
         (finally-return coll intermediate-values))
#+end_src

Implied accumulation variables are not required to always be in the correct
order, so commands using such variables can produce more efficient code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Similar in efficiency to the below:
  ;; => (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 ...)
  (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 1000))
         (collect (1+ i)))

  ;; => (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 ...)
  (let (result)
    (dolist (i (number-sequence 1 1000))
      (push (1+ i) result))
    (nreverse result))
#+end_src

The situation becomes more complex when commands place values at both sides of a
sequence.  In that case, ~loopy~ keeps track of the beginning /and/ the end
of the sequence.  ~loopy~ does /not/ merely append to the end of the resulting
list, since that would be much slower for large lists.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; `loopy' can be faster than the below `dolist' approach:
  ;; => (3 2 1 7 14 21)
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i :at start)
         (collect (* i 7) :at end))

  ;; For large accumulations, this is slower than the above:
  ;; => (3 2 1 7 14 21)
  (let (result)
    (dolist (i '(1 2 3))
      (setq result (cons i result)
            result (nconc result (list (* i 7)))))
    result)
#+end_src

In such cases, ~loopy~ will naively optimize placing values at whichever side of
the sequences appears to be more used.  In the example below, note that even
though the commands to insert values at the front of the list are never actually
run, ~loopy~ will still optimize for frontal insertions.  Here, ~loopy~ simply
counts that 2 commands seem to place values at the front of the list while only
1 command seems to place values at the end.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; This code optimizes for insertions at the front of the list:
  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i :at end)
         (when nil
           (collect i :at start)
           (collect i :at start)))
#+end_src

The special macro argument =accum-opt= can be used to better control these
optimizations ([[#macro-arguments]]).  With it, you can (1) treat an explicit
variable as if it were implicit and optionally (2) specify which side of a
sequence you expect to use more.  The arguments passed to =accum-opt= are either
symbols (such as ~loopy-result~) or lists of a symbol and a position.  To be
clear, use of the variable ~loopy-result~ is always at least naively optimized
in the manner described above.

In the example below, see that
1. Accumulation into the named variable ~coll~ has been explicitly optimized for
   using the end of the sequence, despite there being more commands that use the
   beginning of the sequence.
2. Because accumulation into ~coll~ has been optimized, the order of values in
   ~coll~ need not be correct during the loop.


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; This code optimizes for insertions at the end of `coll':
  ;; => ((23 13 22 12 21 11 1 2 3)
  ;;     ((1 11 21) (2 1 11 21 12 22) (3 2 1 11 21 12 22 13 23)))
  (loopy (accum-opt (coll end))
         (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect coll i :at end)
         (collect coll (+ 10 i) :at start)
         (collect coll (+ 20 i) :at start)
         (collect intermediate-values (copy-sequence coll))
         (finally-return coll intermediate-values))
#+end_src

#+cindex: accum-opt vs. split
The =accump-opt= special macro argument can also be used with destructuring.
Because destructuring requires using named variables, such variables are by
default required to be ordered correctly during the loop.  If you do not require
that, you are recommended to use =accum-opt= on those variables.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((1 3)
  ;;     (2 4)
  ;;     ((1) (3 1))
  ;;     ((2) (4 2)))

commands and use the =split= flag with accumulations ([[#flags]]).  Both options
remove the sorting requirements on the accumulations variables.

** Checking Conditions

{{{dfn(Boolean commands)}}} are used to test whether a condition holds true
during the loop.  Under certain conditions, they cause the loop to exit and
return a value.  Like accumulation commands, they have an implicit return value
which is used if these commands do not cause the loop to exit.

For convenience, these commands can be passed multiple conditions.

The loop is contained in a ~cl-block~, which can be exited by the function
~cl-return-from~.  Indeed, the =return= and =return-from= commands are just
wrappers around that function.

As with the =finally-return= special macro argument, passing multiple return
values to those commands will return a list of those values.  If no value is
given, ~nil~ is returned.

The commands =leave=, =leave-from=, =while=, and =until= leave the current loop
without forcing a returned value.  Unlike the =return= commands, they do not
stop the loop from returning any implied return values, such as the collections
in their respective examples.

The following commands exist to properly handle sub-loops.  Depending on
one's needs, trying to use a ~loopy~ macro call inside the =do= command could
signal an error.  This is because arguments of the =do= command are inserted
literally (that is, without interpretation or modification) into the expanded
code.  This means that using ~loopy~ inside the =do= command cannot affect
any of the super-loop's generated code, such as variable declarations.  The
following commands do not have that problem, because their expansions are
processed during the expansion of the top-level macro.

* The ~loopy-iter~ Macro
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: loopy-iter
:DESCRIPTION: Embedding loop commands in arbitrary code.
:END:

#+cindex: loopy-iter
#+findex: loopy-iter
~loopy-iter~ is a macro that allows the embedding of loop commands inside of
arbitrary code.  This is different from the loop command =do=, which allows the
embedding of arbitrary code inside of a ~loopy~ loop.  You must use ~require~ to
load this feature.

This macro is named after the ~iterate~ or ~iter~ macro provided by the Common
Lisp package "Iterate" [fn:iter] (not to be confused with the ~iter-*~ functions
provided by Emacs).  However, while influenced by ~iterate~, ~loopy-iter~ is not
a port of ~iterate~ to Emacs Lisp.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'loopy-iter) ; <- Must `require' to load feature.

  ;; => ((1 2 3) (-3 -2 -1) (0))
  (loopy-iter (accum-opt positives negatives other)
              (numbering i :from -3 :to 3)
              (pcase i
                ((pred cl-plusp)  (collecting positives i))
                ((pred cl-minusp) (collecting negatives i))
                (_                (collecting other i)))
              (finally-return positives negatives other))

  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy-iter (listing elem '(1 2 3))
              (funcall #'(lambda (x) (collecting x))
                       elem))
#+end_src

The arguments of ~loopy~ are limited to loop commands and special macro
arguments.  ~loopy-iter~ differs by allowing arbitrary Lisp expressions, in
which loop commands are treated as macros to be expanded by ~macroexpand-all~.
Hence, a loop command could overshadow the function value of a symbol.  There
are two ways to avoid such conflicts.

The first way is to use non-conflicting aliases.  Like in Iterate (and
~cl-loop~, to an extent), almost all commands in ~loopy~ have aliases in the
present participle form (the "-ing" form).  For example, Loopy provides the
command =list= with the alias =listing=.  Because the command name =list= would
conflict with the built-in Emacs Lisp function ~list~, only the command name
=listing= is supported by default.  These names of commands and special macro
arguments are called {{{dfn(bare names)}}} to distinguish them from the second
way of avoiding conflicts.  The complete list of commands and special macro
arguments that are recognized by default is given in the section
[[#iter-default-names]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; In `loopy', `list' is unambiguously a command name.
  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (loopy outer
         (list i '((1 2) (3 4)))
         (loop (list j i)
               (at outer (collect j))))

  ;; In `loopy-iter', `list' would be a function.  `listing' is the command.
  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (loopy-iter outer
              (listing i '((1 2) (3 4)))
              (loopy-iter (listing j i)
                          ;; Can use `at' instead of `atting':
                          (at outer (collecting j))))
#+end_src

#+vindex: loopy-iter-bare-commands
The command aliases recognized by ~loopy-iter~ can be customized with the user
option ~loopy-iter-bare-commands~, which is a list of symbols naming commands
and their aliases.  Again, these commands are found in the loop body using Emacs
Lisp's macro-expansion features, so adding an alias that overrides a symbol's
function definition can cause errors.  ~loopy~, whose environment is more
limited, does not have this restriction.

#+vindex: loopy-iter-bare-special-macro-arguments
The special macro arguments (and their aliases) recognized by ~loopy-iter~ can
be set in the user option ~loopy-iter-bare-special-macro-arguments~.  Some of
their built-in aliases, such as =let*= for =with=, are excluded by default.

#+cindex: loopy-iter keywords
#+vindex: loopy-iter-keywords
The first method above deals with looping features that are written like
functions.  If for some reason a suitable alias cannot be used or cannot be
added to one of the above user options, one can write the feature name preceded
by one of the keywords in ~loopy-iter-keywords~.  This is the second method.

By default, the possible keywords are =for=, =accum=, =exit=, and =arg=.  These
symbols do not share a name with any built-in Emacs feature and are similar to
the keywords used by other packages.  Note that these are not Lisp "keywords"
that are prefixed with a colon, such as the =:test= in ~(cl-count ITEM SEQ :test
FUNC)~.  For example,
- the command =(listing VAR LIST)= could also be written as =(for list VAR
  LIST)=.
- the special marco argument =with=, with the alias =let*=, could also be
  written as =(arg let* (VAR EXPR) ...)=.  See that this does not conflict with
  using the ~let*~ special form.

This method recognizes all commands and their aliases in the user option
~loopy-aliases~.

#+caption: The first example, but now using keyword symbols.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((1 2 3) (-3 -2 -1) (0))
  (loopy-iter (arg accum-opt positives negatives other)
              (for nums i :from -3 :to 3)
              (pcase i
                ((pred cl-plusp)  (accum collect positives i))
                ((pred cl-minusp) (accum collect negatives i))
                (_                (accum collect other i)))
              (arg finally-return positives negatives other))
#+end_src

While the symbols =for=, =accum=, =exit=, and =arg= are named for iteration,
accumulation, early exits, and special macro arguments, respectively, any
keyword in the user option ~loopy-iter-keywords~ can be used to identify any
loop command or special macro argument.  For example, =(accum collect a)= and
=(for collect a)= are both valid ways of referring to the =collect= loop command
in ~loopy-iter~.  Instead of =(arg let* (a 7))= in the example above, one could
also write =(exit let* (a 7))= if one really wanted to.

Restrictions on the placement of loop commands and special macro arguments
still apply in ~loopy-iter~.  For example, iteration commands must still occur
at the top level of ~loopy-iter~ or a sub-loop.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; BAD
  (loopy-iter (let ((a (progn
                         ;; ERROR: `listing' must occur at the top level.
                         (listing j '(8 9 10 11 12))
                         j)))
                (collecting a)))

  ;; GOOD
  ;; => (8 9 10 11 12)
  (loopy-iter (let ((a (progn
                         ;; NOTE: No restriction on placement of `setting'.
                         (setting j 8 (1+ j))
                         (when (> j 12) (leaving))
                         j)))
                (collecting a)))
#+end_src

In the macro ~loopy~, the commands =loopy= and =loopy-iter= are needed to
correctly handle sub-loops.  Those commands are not needed in the macro
~loopy-iter~, since the macro expands any macros in its argument while
processing them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (2 3 4 5)
  (loopy-iter outer
              (listing i '([1 2] [3 4]))
              ;; NOTE: `loopy-iter' macro, not command
              (loopy-iter (arraying j i)
                          (at outer
                              (let ((val (1+ j)))
                                (collecting val)))))

  ;; => (2 3 4 5)
  (loopy-iter outer
              (listing i '([1 2] [3 4]))
              ;; NOTE: `loopy' macro, not command
              (loopy (array j i)
                     (set val (1+ j))
                     (at outer (collect val))))
#+end_src

Finally, there are a few things to keep in mind when using ~loopy-iter~:
1. You should not rely on the value of a loop command's expanded code.  Such
   expanded code is an implementation detail and subject to change.
2. Some macros, especially those that interact with each other, produce broken
   code while ~loopy-iter~ is expanding its arguments.  For example,
   ~cl-return-from~ is known to be problematic, since it tries to interact with
   the correct ~cl-block~.

   Macros that should not be expanded while ~loopy-iter~ expands are listed in
   ~loopy-iter-suppressed-macros~.  Note that this suppression is only in effect
   while ~loopy-iter~ expands its loop commands.  Once ~loopy-iter~ outputs its
   code, Emacs will attempt to further expand any macros in the outputted code.

   Ideally, such problematic macros are infrequent.  Please report such cases on
   this project's [[https://github.com/okamsn/loopy/issues][issues tracker]] so that they can be added to
   ~loopy-iter-suppressed-macros~ by default.

** Default Bare Names in ~loopy-iter~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: iter-default-names
:END:

This section lists the default aliases supported as bare names in the macro
~loopy-iter~.  The list of supported bare names can be customized in the user
options ~loopy-iter-bare-commands~ and
~loopy-iter-bare-special-macro-arguments~.

By default, the following commands are not recognized.
- =do= and =group=, which are not needed.
- Commands that exists only as a command version of an existing Lisp feature,
  such as =if=, =cond=, =when=, and =unless=.
- The commands =loopy= and =loopy-iter=.  The macro ~loopy-iter~ expands macros
  in its arguments, and so can properly handle instances of itself and the macro
  ~loopy~ without needing them to be reimplemented as loop commands.
- =while=, as it would conflict with the special form ~while~.
  Use ~(when (not COND) (leaving))~ or ~(unless COND (leaving))~ instead.
- =until=, to be consistent with the exclusion of =while=.

Using the commands =returning= and =returning-from= are the same as using the
macros ~cl-return~ and ~cl-return-from~, except that the commands automatically
create a list if enough return values are given.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (6 7 8)
  (loopy-iter (numbering n :from 0 :to 10)

* Using Flags
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: flags
:DESCRIPTION: Using flags to change behavior.
:END:

#+cindex: flag
A {{{dfn(flag)}}} is a symbol passed to the =flag= or =flags= special macro
argument, changing the macro's behavior.  Currently, flags affect what method
~loopy~ uses to perform destructuring (=pcase=, =seq=, =dash=, or the default)
and whether accumulation commands that don't specify a variable (such as
=(collect collect-value)=) accumulate into one or several variables.

Flags are applied in order.  If you specify =(flags seq pcase)=, then ~loopy~
will use ~pcase-let~ for destructuring, not ~seq-let~.

#+vindex: loopy-default-flags
If you wish to always use a flag, you can add that flag to the list
~loopy-default-flags~.  These can be overridden by any flag given in the =flag=
special macro argument.

The following flags are currently supported:

#+cindex: pcase flag
- =pcase= :: Use ~pcase-let~ for destructuring
  ([[info:elisp#Destructuring with pcase Patterns]]).
#+cindex: seq flag
- =seq= :: Use ~seq-let~ for destructuring ([[info:elisp#seq-let]]).
#+cindex: dash flag
- =dash= :: Use the style of destructuring found in the =dash= library
 ([[info:dash#-let]]).
#+cindex: split flag
- =split= :: Make accumulation commands with implicit variables accumulate into
  separate variables, which are then collected into ~loopy-result~.  This flag
  is described more in [[#accumulation-commands]].
#+cindex: default flag
- =default= :: Use the default behavior for all options.


For convenience, all flags (except =default=) can be undone by prefixing them
with =-= (a dash or minus sign), which reverts ~loopy~ to its default behavior.

For example, if you have set ~loopy-default-flags~ to =(dash split)= and wish to
only use the =split= flag for a loop, you can use either =(flags default split)=
or, more simply, =(flag -dash)=.  These prefixed flags only apply when the
unprefixed version is active.  That is, =(flags pcase -dash)= is the same as
just =(flags pcase)=, regardless of the value of ~loopy-default-flags~, as
=pcase= destructuring will override all uses of =dash= destructuring as it comes
later in the list.  Similarly, =(flags -dash dash)= and =(flags -dash +dash)=
leave =dash= destructuring enabled, and =(flags +dash -dash)= disables =dash=
destructuring and uses the default behavior.

#+cindex: loopy-dash
#+cindex: loopy-pcase
#+cindex: loopy-seq
The destructuring flags (=pcase=, =seq=, and =dash=) are separate libraries
(respectively, =loopy-pcase=, =loopy-seq=, and =loopy-dash=) that must be
loaded after =loopy=.  Currently, =loopy-dash= is a separate package.

Below are some example of using the destructuring flags.  These flags affect
the destructuring of:
- iteration variables
- accumulation variables
- variables bound by the special macro argument =with=

#+attr_texinfo: :tag Note
#+begin_quote
These flags do not affect the destructuring of generalized variables
(~setf~-able places) as the libraries =pcase.el=, =seq.el=, and =dash.el= do not
yet provide the required functionality.
#+end_quote

         (sum sum1 i)
         (sum sum2 j)
         (finally-return (+ sum1 v1) (+ sum2 v2)))
#+end_src

As noted in previous sections, the =split= flag can be used to generate more
efficient code for accumulation commands ([[#accumulation-commands]]).  By making
stronger guarantees about how accumulation variables can be used, ~loopy~ can
produce results fasters.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   ;; Both of these example give the same result, but the latter
   ;; can expand into more efficient code.
   ;;
   ;; There is also the `push-into' command, which avoids this problem when

   ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
   (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
          (collect (i j k) elem)
          (finally-return i j k))

   ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
   (loopy (flag split) ; Don't accumulate into same implicit variable.
          (list (i j k) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
          (collect i)
          (collect j)
          (collect k))
 #+end_src

 Below is an example of the =split= flag.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   ;; => (1 2 3 4 5)

* Custom Aliases
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: custom-aliases
:DESCRIPTION: How to add one's own aliases.
:END:

#+cindex: custom aliases
An {{{dfn(alias)}}} is another name for a command or special macro argument.
~loopy~ comes with several built-in aliases, such as =string= for the command
=array= or =else= for the special macro argument =after-do=.

| Command or Special Macro Argument | Built-In Aliases           |
|-----------------------------------+----------------------------|
| =array=                           | =string=                   |
| =seq-ref=                         | =sequence-ref=, =seqf=     |
| =after-do=                        | =after=, =else=, =else-do= |


An alias works the same as the original command or special macro argument.
They are provided for clarity and convenience.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ("a" "b" "c" "d")
  (loopy (array i "abcd")
         (collect (char-to-string i)))

  ;; => ("a" "b" "c" "d")
  (loopy (string i "abcd")
         (collect (char-to-string i)))
#+end_src

#+findex: loopy-defalias
Users can define custom aliases using the macro ~loopy-defalias~, which takes an
alias and a definition as arguments.  These arguments can be quoted or unquoted.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (loopy-defalias items array)

  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy (items i [1 2 3])
         (collect i))
#+end_src

The definition must exist for the alias to be defined correctly.  Definitions
can themselves be aliases, so long as they are already defined.  In other words,
when aliasing custom commands, you should define the alias /after/ defining the
command ([[#adding-custom-commands]]).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Define an alias for the `items' alias from above:
  (loopy-defalias items2 items)

  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy (items2 i [1 2 3])
         (collect i))
#+end_src

When looking for how to parse a command, ~loopy~ will check aliases before
checking the true names of commands.  Effectively, this means that commands can
be overridden by aliases, though this is discouraged.  Such commands can still
be accessed via their other names.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Define `cons' as an alias of `array':
  (loopy-defalias cons array)

  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy (cons i [1 2 3])
         (collect i))

  ;; ERROR: Can no longer use the original definition:
  (loopy (cons i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i))

  ;; Other names still work:
  ;; => ((1 2 3) (2 3) (3))
  (loopy (conses i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i))
#+end_src

Special macro arguments ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]) can also be aliased.  Using an
alias does not change the fact that the special macro arguments are parsed
before loop commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (loopy-defalias as with)

  ;; => (8 9 10)
  (loopy (as (a 7))
         (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect (+ i 7)))
#+end_src

#+vindex: loopy-aliases
The macro ~loopy-defalias~ modifies the user option ~loopy-aliases~.  However,
while ~loopy~ is still changing, it is recommended to avoid modifying this
variable directly, as its structure may change in the future.  ~loopy-defalias~
is the forward-compatible way of creating aliases.

* Custom Commands
:PROPERTIES:

:DESCRIPTION: Extending `loopy' with personal commands.
:END:

This section contains information about how loop commands work and how one can
add custom commands to ~loopy~.  Two examples are provided.

#+cindex: instruction, instructions
The core working of ~loopy~ is taking a loop command and generating code that
becomes part of a ~while~-loop.  This code is represented by
{{{dfn(instructions)}}}, which basically describe where and how code is inserted
into and around a template of a ~while~-loop.

Some examples of instructions are:
- Declaring a given variable in a ~let~-like form to make sure it's locally
  scoped.
- Declaring a generated variable in a ~let~-like form to contain a given value.
- Adding a condition for continuing/exiting the loop.
- Adding code to be run during the main processing section of the ~while~-loop.
  This location is referred to as the {{{dfn(main body)}}} of the loop.
- Adding code to be run after the main processing section, such as for updating
  variables.  This location is referred to as the {{{dfn(latter body)}}} of the
  loop.

For example, parsing the command =(list i '(1 2 3))= produces the following list
of instructions.  Some commands require the creation of unique temporary
variables, such as =list-211= in the below output.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ((loopy--iteration-vars (list-211 '(1 2 3)))
   (loopy--iteration-vars (i nil))
   (loopy--pre-conditions (consp list-211))
   (loopy--main-body      (setq i (car list-211)))
   (loopy--latter-body    (setq list-211 (cdr list-211))))
#+END_SRC

The first element of an instruction describes where to insert code into the
template.  The second element of an instruction is the inserted code.  You can
see that not all of the code to be inserted is a valid Lisp form.  For example,
the above instruction referencing ~loopy--iteration-vars~ inserts a binding for
the variable =list-211= into a ~let~-like form.

| Place                   | Code                             |
|-------------------------+----------------------------------|
| =loopy--iteration-vars= | =(list-211 '(1 2 3))=            |
| =loopy--latter-body=    | =(setq list-211 (cdr list-211))= |
| =loopy--pre-conditions= | =(consp list-211)=               |
| =loopy--iteration-vars= | =(i nil)=                        |
| =loopy--main-body=      | =(setq i (car list-211)))=       |

#+cindex: instruction order
Instructions are applied in order in such a way that earlier instructions are
not overridden by later instructions.  For example, if the special macro
argument =with= sets a variable's value, that value will not be overridden by
commands which might try to initialize that variable to ~nil~.  This works
because special macro arguments are always parsed before loop commands.

#+findex: loopy--parse-loop-command
#+findex: loopy--parse-loop-commands
Commands are parsed by ~loopy--parse-loop-command~, which receives a command
call, such as =(list i '(1 2 3))=, and returns a list of instructions.  It does
this by searching for an appropriate command-specific parsing function in
~loopy-aliases~ and ultimately in ~loopy-command-parsers~.  For parsing multiple
commands in order, there is ~loopy--parse-loop-commands~, which wraps the
single-command version.

For example, consider the function ~loopy--parse-if-command~, which parses the
=if= loop command.  It needs to check the instructions of the sub-commands
passed to =if=, looking for code that would be inserted into the main loop body
(as determined by the first element of the instruction).  Once found, it wraps
that code with an ~if~-form.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((loopy--iteration-vars (i nil))
  ;;     (loopy--main-body (setq i 1)))
  (loopy--parse-loop-command '(set i 1))

  ;; => ((loopy--iteration-vars (i nil))
  ;;     (loopy--main-body (if (my-condition)
  ;;                           (setq i 1)
  ;;                         (setq i 2))))
  (loopy--parse-if-command '(if (my-condition)
                                (set i 1)
                              (set i 2)))
#+end_src

For the purpose of this example, below is a version of the parsing function made
of the basic Lisp features with which you are familiar.  The actual definition
makes use of more convenient Emacs Lisp libraries and can be seen in the library
{{{file(loopy-commands.el)}}}.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'loopy-commands)
  (defun loopy--parse-if-command (arg)
    "Parse the `if' loop command usage ARG.
  ARG is of the form (if CONDITION IF-TRUE &rest IF-FALSE)."

    (let ((condition (cadr arg))   ; Second element of `arg'.
          (if-true   (caddr arg))  ; Third element of `arg'.
          (if-false  (cdddr arg))) ; Remaining elements of `arg'.

      ;; The main processing of this function is to separate instructions
      ;; for the loop's main body from other instructions,
      ;; and to then wrap those main-body instructions with an
      ;; `if' special form.
      (let ((full-instructions)
            (if-true-main-body)
            (if-false-main-body)
            ;; This variable is just so that iteration commands know when
            ;; they are being used away from the top level of the loop's
            ;; structure (which is an error).
            (loopy--in-sub-level t))

        ;; Process the instructions for the command that should run if the
        ;; condition is true.
        (dolist (instruction (loopy--parse-loop-command if-true))
          (if (eq 'loopy--main-body (car instruction))
              (push (cadr instruction) if-true-main-body)
            (push instruction full-instructions)))

        ;; Process the instructions for the commands that should run
        ;; if the condition is false.
        (dolist (instruction (loopy--parse-loop-commands if-false))
          (if (eq 'loopy--main-body (car instruction))
              (push (cadr instruction) if-false-main-body)
            (push instruction full-instructions)))

        ;; Note: `push' adds elements to the front of a list,
        ;;       so we need to reverse these lists before returning
        ;;       the new list of instructions.

        ;; `loopy--parse-loop-command' always returns a list of instructions.
        ;; For some commands, that means wrapping multiple instructions in
        ;; a `progn' form.  For others, we need to extract the only element.
        (setq if-true-main-body
              (if (= 1 (length if-true-main-body))
                  (car if-true-main-body)
                (cons 'progn (nreverse if-true-main-body))))

        ;; Return the new, full list of instructions.
        (cons `(loopy--main-body
                . (if ,condition
                      ,if-true-main-body
                    ,@(nreverse if-false-main-body)))
              (nreverse full-instructions)))))
#+END_SRC

The hardest part of this exchange is making sure that the inserted code ends up
in the correct order.

A loop command has 7 main places to put code:

#+vindex: loopy--generalized-vars
- =loopy--generalized-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and a macro expansion that will
  be given to =cl-symbol-macrolet=.  This is used to create named ~setf~-able
  places.  The expansion you use depends on the kind of sequence and how the it
  is updated.

  For example, =(list-ref i my-list)= declares =i= to be a symbol which expands
  to =(car TEMP-VAR)=, in which =TEMP-VAR= holds the value of =my-list=.  At the
  end of the loop body, =TEMP-VAR= is set to its =cdr=, ensuring that the next
  call to =car= returns the correct value.

#+vindex: loopy--iteration-vars
- =loopy--iteration-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and an expression that will be
  given to ~let*~.  This is used for initializing variables needed for iteration
  commands, such as the =i= in =(list i '(1 2 3))= or to store the list ='(1 2
  3)= in =(list i '(1 2 3))=.  This also includes variables needed for
  destructuring.

#+vindex: loopy--accumulation-vars
- =loopy--accumulation-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and an expression that will be
  given to ~let*~.  This is used for initializing variables needed for
  accumulation commands, such as the =coll= in =(collect coll my-val)= or any
  variables needed for destructuring.

#+vindex: loopy--pre-conditions
- =loopy--pre-conditions= :: Expressions that determine if the =while= loop
  runs/continues, such as whether a list still has elements in it.  If there is
  more than one expression, than all expressions are used in an =and= special
  form.

#+vindex: loopy--main-body
- =loopy--main-body= :: Expressions that make up the main body of the loop.

#+vindex: loopy--latter-body
- =loopy--latter-body= :: Expressions that need to be run after the main body,
  such as updating some of variables that determine when a loop ends.

#+vindex: loopy--post-conditions
- =loopy--post-conditions= :: Expressions that determine whether the =while=
  loop continues, but checked after the loop body has run.  The code from this
  is ultimately appended to the latter body before being substituted in.

For accumulation commands, you might also wish to place values in the following:

#+vindex: loopy--implicit-return
- =loopy--implicit-return= :: A list of values to be returned by the loop if no
  other return value is specified/reached.  A value is added to this list when
  an accumulation command does not specify an accumulation variable, and in some
  special other cases.

  By default, the implicit return value is ~loopy-result~, and so this variable
  is usually just a list of the symbol =loopy-result=.  When the =split= flag is
  enabled, this is a list of values to which ~loopy-result~ is bound.

#+vindex: loopy--accumulation-final-updates
- =loopy--accumulation-final-updates= :: Actions to perform on the accumulation
  variable after the loop ends.  Some implied accumulation commands need to
  update the variable one final time after ending the loop.  Some examples are:
  1. Correcting the order of elements in a list that was constructed in reverse.
  2. Coercing the variable into a new sequence type, for commands with the
     ~:result-type~ argument.

  Each accumulation variable can only be updated once, in a single way.  For
  example, a variable cannot be reversed according to the needs of one command
  and then coerced into a new type according to the needs of another.  Commands
  acting on the same accumulation variable must require the same final update,
  if they require any final update.


Loopy will attempt to produce efficient code, and will not attempt to set up
features which are not used.  Therefore, the expanded code depends on the kinds
of instructions that are returned by the parsing functions.  For the most part,
the instructions affect the expansion of the loop that contains their respective
command.  However, there are cases where a command must send instructions to a
surrounding loop, not just the loop which immediately contains it.  Consider
using an accumulation command within the =at= command, as in the below example.
The accumulation variable must be declared for the loop =outer=, but the
accumulation itself must still occur within the loop =inner=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (loopy outer
         (array i [(1 2) (3 4)])
         (sub-loop inner
                   (list j i)
                   (at outer (collect coll j)))
         (finally-return coll))
#+end_src

To communicate these instructions, use ~loopy--at-instructions~.  For example,
the output of parsing =(at outer (collect j :at start))= would be a list of
instructions similar to those below.  While all of these sub-instructions are
produced by parsing the =collect= command, not all are sent to the loop =outer=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ((loopy--at-instructions
    (outer (loopy--accumulation-vars (loopy-result nil))
           (loopy--implicit-return loopy-result)))
   (loopy--main-body (setq loopy-result (cons j loopy-result))))
#+end_src

#+vindex: loopy--at-instructions
- =loopy--at-instructions= :: Instructions that should be interpreted by a
  surrounding loop.  For example, this kind of instruction is used by the =at=,
  =skip-from=, and =leave-from= commands.  The instruction's value is a list of
  a loop name followed by sub-instructions.

  This variable works as a something like a combination of a stack and a map.
  This means that then when multiple surrounding loops share the same name, the
  instructions affect the innermost surrounding loop of that name.


There are 4 more variables a loop command can push to, but they are derived from
the macro's arguments.  Adding to them after using a macro argument might lead
to unintended behavior.  You might wish to use them if, for example, you are
concerned with what happens after the loop exits/completes.

#+vindex: loopy--before-do
- =loopy--before-do= :: Expressions to evaluate before the loop.  These are
  derived from the =before-do= macro argument.

#+vindex: loopy--after-do
- =loopy--after-do= :: Expressions to evaluate after the loop completes
  successfully.  These are derived from the =after-do= macro argument.

#+vindex: loopy--final-do
- =loopy--final-do= :: Expressions to evaluate after the loop completes,
  regardless of success.  These are derived from the =finally-do= macro
  argument.

#+vindex: loopy--final-return
- =loopy--final-return= :: An expression that is always returned by the macro,
  regardless of any early returns in the loop body.  This is derived from the
  =finally-return= macro argument.


#+vindex: loopy--loop-name
Some commands might depend on the name of the loop.  The symbol which names the
loop is stored in the variable ~loopy--loop-name~.  The default name is ~nil~.

The structure of the macro’s expanded code depends on the features used (for
example, ~loopy~ won’t try to declare variables if none exist), but the result
will work similar to the below example.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  `(cl-symbol-macrolet ,loopy--generalized-vars
     (let* ,loopy--with-vars
       (let ,loopy--accumulation-vars

           (let ((loopy--early-return-capture
                  (cl-block ,loopy--loop-name
                    ,@loopy--before-do
                    (catch loopy--non-returning-exit-tag-name
                      (while ,(cl-case (length loopy--pre-conditions)
                                (0 t)
                                (1 (car loopy--pre-conditions))
                                (t (cons 'and loopy--pre-conditions)))
                        (catch loopy--skip-tag-name
                          ,@loopy--main-body)
                        ,@loopy--latter-body
                        (unless ,loopy--post-conditions
                          (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name
                            ,loopy--implicit-return)))
                      ,loopy--accumulation-final-updates
                      ,@loopy--after-do))
                  ,loopy--implicit-return))
             ,@loopy--final-do
             ,(if loopy--final-return
                  loopy--final-return

** Hello World
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: a-small-example
:DESCRIPTION: A minimal working example.
:END:

To implement a custom loop body command, =loopy= needs two pieces of
information:
1. The keyword that names your command
2. The parsing function that can turn uses of your command into instructions.

Importantly, your custom commands cannot share a name.

For example, say that you're tired of typing out =(do (message "Hello, %s %s"
PERSONAL-NAME FAMILY-NAME))= and would prefer to instead use =(greet
PERSONAL-NAME [FAMILY-NAME])=.  This only requires adding code to the loop's
main body, so the definition of the parsing function is quite simple.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'cl-lib)
  (cl-defun my-loopy-greet-command-parser
      ((_ personal-name &optional family-name))
    "Greet one with PERSONAL-NAME and optional FAMILY-NAME."
    `((loopy--main-body
       (if ,family-name
           (message "Hello, %s %s" ,personal-name ,family-name)
         (message "Hello, %s" ,personal-name)))))
#+END_SRC

=loopy= will pass the entire command expression to the parsing function, and
expects that a list of instructions will be returned.

#+vindex: loopy-command-parsers
To tell =loopy= about this function, add it and the command name =greet= to the
variable ~loopy-command-parsers~, which associates commands with parsing
functions.  The function that is paired with the symbol receives the entire
command expression, and should produce a list of valid instructions.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Using the Map library, for convenience.
  (require 'map)
  (setf (map-elt loopy-command-parsers 'greet)
        #'my-loopy-greet-command-parser)
#+END_SRC

After that, you can use your custom command in the loop body.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (loopy (list name '(("John" "Deer") ("Jane" "Doe") ("Jimmy")))
         (greet (car name) (cadr name)))
#+END_SRC

By running {{{kbd(M-x pp-macroexpand-last-sexp RET)}}} on the above expression,
you can see that it expands to do what we want, as expected.  You might notice
that one shortcoming of the current definition is that if a function is used to
produce the second argument, as in ~(greet (personal-name) (family-name))~, then
that function is called twice.  This occurs with ~(cadr name)~ in the below
output, and can cause problems when using stateful functions.  This particular
case can be resolved by using the macro ~if-let~ to first store the result of
~(cadr name)~, and is something to keep in mind when defining Lisp macro
expansions in general.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; An example expansion.
  (let* ((list-166 '(("John" "Deer") ("Jane" "Doe") ("Jimmy")))
         (name nil))
    (cl-block nil
      (while (consp list-166)
        (setq name (car list-166))
        (if (cadr name)
            (message "Hello, %s %s"
                     (car name)
                     (cadr name))
          (message "Hello, %s"
                   (car name)))
        (setq list-166 (cdr list-166)))
      nil))
#+END_SRC

** An ~always~ Command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: always-example
:DESCRIPTION: Adding a feature from `cl-loop'.
:END:

Lets say we want to emulate ~cl-loop~'s =always= clause, which causes the loop
to return ~nil~ if an expression evaluates to ~nil~ and ~t~ otherwise.  This is
similar to the functions ~cl-every~ and ~seq-every-p~.

Here is an example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; => t
  (cl-loop for i from 1 to 9 always (< i 10))
#+END_SRC

While ~loopy~ already has an =always= command, we'll ignore it for the sake of
this example.  Without a custom command, you could translate this using the
following code:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; => t
  (loopy (numbers i :from 1 :to 9)
         (unless (< i 10) (return nil))
         (else-do (cl-return t)))
#+END_SRC

This is similar to what you might write in other languages, such as Python.

#+begin_src python
  # In some testing Python function:
  for i in range(1, 10):
      if not (i < 10):
          return False
  else:
      return True
#+end_src

While the meaning of the code is clear, this approach is certainly wordier.

Here's how one could do this using a custom command.  Again, =loopy= already
comes with a built-in =always= command.  This example is taken directly from the
file {{{file(loopy-commands.el)}}}, which contains the code of all of ~loopy~'s
built-in parsers.

We can describe the command's desired behavior in two sentences:
1. The loop should immediately return ~nil~ if the expression ever evaluates to
   ~nil~.
2. The loop should return ~t~ if the loop is able to complete successfully.

This simplest way to satisfy the first requirement is to conditionally use
~cl-return~ if the expressions ever evaluates to ~nil~.  We want to do this
while the loop is running, so we should use an instruction for
~loopy--main-body~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; We want to insert the below code into the loop
  (unless CONDITION
    (cl-return nil))

  ;; so we use the instruction
  `(loopy--main-body (unless ,CONDITION (cl-return nil)))

  ;; where CONDITION is supplied by the parsing function.
#+end_src

For a simple loop, this works well enough.  However, the function ~cl-return~
only works with blocks that are named ~nil~.  If we have named the loop, then
~cl-return~ won't work, and might instead cause unexpected errors.  Therefore,
it is better to use ~cl-return-from~ with the variable ~loopy--loop-name~.  As
noted in the previous section, ~loopy--loop-name~ stores the symbol which names
the loop.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  `(loopy--main-body (unless ,CONDITION
                       (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name nil)))
#+end_src

The best way to satisfy the second requirement is to use an instruction for
~loopy--implicit-return~.  One /could/ try to insert code using ~cl-return-from~
into ~loopy--after-do~, and this /would/ cause a value to be returned after the
loop had successfully completed, but doing it that way could unexpectedly
prevent other code in =after-do= from running.  Using an implicit return value
does not have that problem.

This gives us the following instruction, which will add ~t~ to the list of
values the macro returns if nothing else would be returned.  If that list is
just ~'(t)~, then the macro knows to just return ~t~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  '(loopy--implicit-return t)
#+end_src

Once we've chosen our instructions, we need to tell =loopy= what function to use
to produce these instructions.  Like in the previous example, we define the
parsing function and add it to ~loopy-command-parsers~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; As noted in the previous section, the parsing function is always
  ;; passed the entire command as `(always CONDTION)', not just the
  ;; command arguments as `CONDITION'.

  (cl-defun my--loopy-always-command-parser ((_ condition))
    "Parse a command of the form `(always CONDITION)'.

  If any condition is nil, `loopy' should immediately return nil.
  Otherwise, `loopy' should return t."
    `((loopy--implicit-return t)
      (loopy--main-body (unless ,condition
                          (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name nil)))))

  (setf (map-elt loopy-command-parsers 'always)
        #'my--loopy-always-command-parser)
#+end_src

Once we've added our parsing function to ~loopy-command-parsers~, =loopy= will
use that function whenever it tries to understand the =always= command.  In this
case, this custom parser would supercede the built-in parser.

With that done, our custom =always= command is as useful as the corresponding
~cl-loop~ clause.  However, because ~loopy~ uses expressions instead of keyword
clauses like ~cl-loop~, we can do slightly better.  For convenience, we can
easily allow passing multiple conditions to the command instead of just one.  In
such cases, the conditions should be wrapped in an ~and~ form, and that is
indeed what the built-in parser does.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; The built-in parser, taken from `loopy-commands.el':
  (cl-defun loopy--parse-always-command ((_ &rest conditions))
    "Parse a command of the form `(always [CONDITIONS])'.

  If any condition is nil, `loopy' should immediately return nil.
  Otherwise, `loopy' should return t."

Here are some examples of the command in action:

  ;; One condition: => t
  (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9)) (always (< i 10)))

  ;; Two conditions: => nil
  (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9))
         (list j '(2 4 6 8 9))
         (always (< i 10) (cl-evenp j)))

  ;; The previous example is equivalent to this.
  (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9))
         (list j '(2 4 6 8 9))
         (always (and (< i 10) (cl-evenp j))))

** Custom commands in the ~loopy-iter~ macro
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: custom-commands-for-loopy-iter
:END:

See also [[#loopy-iter]].

~loopy-iter~ works by:
1. separating main-body instructions from other instructions
2. expanding that main-body code for ~loopy~ sub-commands
3. collected those expansions into the outputted loop's body
4. processing the collected non-main-body instructions

Most loop commands should work with ~loopy-iter~ without any changes.  Some loop
commands are just ~loopy~ versions of built-in Lisp macros or special forms, and
so aren't needed in ~loopy-iter~ in the first place.

However, special consideration is needed for commands that produce main-body
code outside of main-body instructions, or that assume all of their arguments
are loop commands.  Consider the parser for the =at= command:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (cl-defun loopy--parse-at-command ((_ target-loop &rest commands))
    "Parse the `at' command as (at &rest COMMANDS).

  These commands affect other loops higher up in the call list."
    (loopy--check-target-loop-name target-loop)
    (let ((loopy--loop-name target-loop)
          (loopy--in-sub-level t))
      `((loopy--at-instructions
         (,target-loop
          ,@(loopy--parse-loop-commands commands))))))
#+end_src

All it does is process its arguments and wrap the resulting instructions in an
=at= instruction.  By wrapping main-body instructions in an =at= instruction,
~loopy-iter~ does not see the main-body code, and so cannot use it.  Instead, an
alternative parser must be use:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (cl-defun loopy-iter--parse-at-command ((_ target-loop &rest commands))
  "Parse the `at' command as (at &rest COMMANDS).

These commands affect other loops higher up in the call list."
  (loopy--check-target-loop-name target-loop)
  ;; We need to capture all non-main-body instructions into a new `at'
  ;; instruction, so we just temporarily `let'-bind
  ;; `loopy-iter--non-main-body-instructions' while expanders push to it,
  ;; we which then wrap back in a new instruction and pass up to the calling
  ;; function, which consumes instructions.
  (loopy (with (loopy-iter--non-main-body-instructions nil)
               (loopy--loop-name target-loop)
               (loopy--in-sub-level t))
         (list cmd commands)
         (collect (list 'loopy--main-body (loopy-iter--macroexpand-sub cmd)))
         (finally-return
          ;; Return list of instructions to comply with expectations of calling
          ;; function, which thinks that this is a normal loop-command parser.
          `(,@loopy-result
            (loopy--at-instructions
             (,target-loop
              ,@(thread-last loopy-iter--non-main-body-instructions
                             nreverse
                             (apply #'append))))))))
#+end_src

#+vindex: loopy-iter--non-main-body-instructions
This ~loopy-iter~-specific definition separates the main-body instructions out
from the other instructions so that ~loopy-iter~ can operate on their values
directly.  The variable ~loopy-iter--non-main-body-instructions~ is a place
where the macro-expanding parsers used by ~loopy-iter~ can push lists of
instructions (see the code for usage examples).

#+vindex: loopy-iter-overwritten-command-parsers
These alternative command parsers are listed in
~loopy-iter-overwritten-command-parsers~.

* Comparing to ~cl-loop~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: comparing-to-cl-loop
:DESCRIPTION: Why `loopy' instead of `cl-loop'.
:END:

~loopy~ is a better version of ~cl-loop~, judging by the following:
- It as fast or faster than ~cl-loop~, though some optimizations are more
  explicit.

- Loop commands are always evaluated in order.

- ~loopy~ provides a more complete destructuring system, which can be swapped out
  with others.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; No array destructuring in `cl-loop'.
    ;; => (3 7)
    (loopy (list [i j] '([1 2] [3 4]))
           (collect (+ i j)))
  #+end_src

- ~loopy~ provides more looping constructs out of the box with a (according to
  the author) clearer naming scheme than ~cl-loop~'s =for= clauses.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (loopy (list i my-var1)
           (array j my-var2)
           (collect (cons i j)))

    (cl-loop for i in my-var1
             for j across my-var2
             collect (cons i j))
  #+end_src

- Taking influence from CL's Iterate, several ~loopy~ commands are more
  featureful than their ~cl-loop~ counterparts.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; `array' is more featureful than `for-across'.
    ;; => ((9 . 20) (7 . 18) (5 . 16) (3 . 14) (1 . 12))
    (loopy (array i [11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20]
                  :downfrom 9 :by 2 :to 1 :index idx)
           (collect (cons idx i)))
  #+end_src

- ~loopy~ provides more control over what happens after and around the loop.
  ~cl-loop~ lacks equivalents of the following special macro arguments:
  - =after-do=: There is only a ~finally do~.
  - =without=: There is no way to prevent ~cl-loop~ from binding variables.
  - =finally-protect=: Though niche, ~loopy~ can wrap only the loop body in
    ~unwind-protect~.
  - =accum-opt=: Named accumulations are always more slow than implicit
    accumulations in ~cl-loop~, even when they don't need to be.
  - =wrap=: Again niche, but missing from ~cl-loop~.

- ~loopy~ is more extensible.  Loop commands can be added easily.

- When using ~loopy-iter~, the macro is more flexible in how it can be used.

* Translating to and from =cl-loop=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: translating-from-cl-loop
:DESCRIPTION: Converting `cl-loop' to `loopy', and vice versa.
:END:

~loopy~ and ~cl-loop~ use slightly different terminology.  The equivalent of
"for clauses" are referred to as "iteration commands" in ~loopy~, as they are
generally used for iterating through sequences.  Meanwhile, "iteration clauses"
can be separated into "iteration commands" (=list= and =array=) and "early-exit
commands" (=while= and =until=).

"Accumulation clauses" work the same as "accumulation commands".

** For Clauses
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: for-clauses
:END:

As Emacs has many functions that return lists, there is no need to implement an
exact equivalent for every =for=-clause that ~cl-loop~ has.  Instead, one can
just iterate through the return value of the appropriate function using the
=list= command.

For the commands operating on hash tables, see also the generic iteration
command =map-pairs=, which works generically on hash tables, association lists
("alists"), property lists ("plists"), and vectors.

accumulation commands to accumulate into separate variables, simple provide
=VAR= to the command or use the =split= flag ([[#flags][Using Flags]]).

** Other Clauses
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: other-clauses
:END:

In ~loopy~, =if=, =when=, and =unless= can take multiple loop commands as
arguments, and operate more like their Lisp counterparts.

This means that =if= is not a synonym for =when=.  Just like the normal Lisp
special form ~if~, =(if COND cmd1 cmd2 cmd3)= only runs =cmd1= if =COND=
evaluates to non-nil, and only runs commands =cmd2= and =cmd3= if =COND=
evaluates to ~nil~.

~loopy~ also provides the command =cond=, which works like the normal Lisp
special form ~cond~.
