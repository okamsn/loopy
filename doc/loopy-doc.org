~loopy~ is a macro meant for iterating and looping.  It is similar in usage to
~cl-loop~ ([[info:cl#Loop Facility]]) but uses symbolic expressions rather than
keywords.

For most use cases, ~loopy~ should a nice substitute for ~cl-loop~ and
complementary to the features provided by the =seq= ([[info:elisp#Sequence Functions]])
and =cl-lib= ([[info:cl]]) libraries and Emacs's regular looping and mapping features.

* Introduction
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: A short overview.
  :END:

  The ~loopy~ macro is used to generate code for a loop, similar to ~cl-loop~.
  Unlike ~cl-loop~, ~loopy~ uses symbolic expressions instead of "clauses".

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; A simple usage of `cl-loop':
    (cl-loop for i from 1 to 10
             if (cl-evenp i) collect i into evens
             else collect i into odds
             end ; This `end' keyword is optional here.
             finally return (list odds evens))

    ;; How it could be done using `loopy':
    (loopy (numbers i 1 10)
           (if (cl-evenp i)
               (collect evens i)
             (collect odds i))
           (finally-return odds evens))
  #+end_src

  ~loopy~ supports destructuring for iteration commands like =list= and
  accumulation commands like =sum= or =collect=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Summing the nth elements of arrays:
    ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
    (loopy (list (list-elem1 list-elem2)
                 '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
                   ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
           (sum [sum1 sum2 sum3] list-elem1)
           (sum [sum4 sum5 sum6] list-elem2)
           (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3 sum4 sum5 sum6))

    ;; Or, more simply:
    ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
    (loopy (list list-elem '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
                             ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
           (sum ([sum1 sum2 sum3] [sum4 sum5 sum6])
                list-elem)
           (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3 sum4 sum5 sum6))

    ;; Separate the elements of sub-list:
    ;; => ((1 3) (2 4))
    (loopy (list i '((1 2) (3 4)))
           (collect (elem1 elem2) i)
           (finally-return elem1 elem2))
  #+end_src

  The ~loopy~ macro is configurable and extensible.  In addition to writing one's
  own "loop commands" (such as =list= in the example below), by using "flags",
  one can choose whether to instead use ~pcase-let~, ~seq-let~, or even the Dash
  library for destructuring.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Use Seq.el to destructure an array:
    ;; => ((1 4) ([2 3] [5 6]))
    (loopy (flag seq)
           (list elem '([1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
           (collect [i &rest j] elem)
           (finally-return i j))
  #+end_src

  Variables like =elem=, =i=, and =j= in the example above are automatically
  ~let~-bound so as to not affect code outside of the loop.

  ~loopy~ has arguments for binding (or not binding) variables, executing code
  before/after the loop, executing code only if the loop completes, and for
  setting the macro's return value (default ~nil~).  This is in addition to the
  looping features themselves.

  All of this makes ~loopy~ a useful and convenient choice for looping and
  iteration.

  That being said, Loopy is not yet feature complete.  Please request features
  or report problems in this project’s [[https://github.com/okamsn/loopy/issues][issues tracker]].  While most cases are
  covered, full feature parity with some of the more niche uses of ~cl-loop~ is
  still being worked on.

* Basic Concepts
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: basic-concepts
  :DESCRIPTION: Basic information about `loopy' and its loops.
  :END:

  Except for an optional loop name, all arguments of the ~loopy~ macro are
  symbolic expressions that create a loop, assigns variables in the lexical
  environment that surrounds the loop, adds code that runs before/after the
  loop, and sets the ultimate return value of the macro.

  For convenience and clarity, symbolic expressions that generate code in the
  loop body are called "loop commands" ([[#loop-commands][Loop Commands]]).  Symbolic
  expressions that generate code around the loop are called "special macro
  arguments" or just "macro arguments" as opposed to "loop commands"
  ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]).

  "Loop commands" are the main feature of the ~loopy~ macro, such as the =list=
  in =(list i '(1 2 3))=.  A command inserts code into the loop body, but can
  also perform additional setup like initializing variables.  Many commands set
  a condition for ending the loop.

  The loop ends when any condition required by a loop command evaluates to
  false.  If no conditions are needed, the loop runs infinitely until a =return=
  or =return-from= command is reached ([[#exiting-the-loop-early][Exiting the Loop Early]]).

  Except when using accumulating loop commands ([[#accumulation-commands][Accumulation Commands]]), return
  values must be stated explicitly, either as an early return in the loop body
  via the =return= or =return-from= commands, or as part of the =finally-return=
  macro argument.  ~nil~ is returned by default.

  The macro is configurable.  One can add custom commands ([[#adding-custom-commands][Custom Commands]]), add
  custom command aliases ([[#custom-aliases][Custom Aliases]]), and specify macro options for a
  particular loop ([[#flags][Using Flags]]).  Each of these ideas is explained in detail
  later in this document.

* Special Macro Arguments
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: macro-arguments
  :DESCRIPTION: Creating the environment of the loop.
  :END:

  #+cindex: special macro argument
  There are only a few special macro arguments. One, an unquoted symbol, is
  taken as the loop's name. The others, listed below, are symbolic expressions
  that begin with a keyword or one of their aliases. You do not need to use all
  of them.

  If a macro argument does not match one of these special few, ~loopy~ will
  attempt to interpret it as a loop command, and throw an error if that fails.

  These special macro arguments are always processed before loop commands,
  regardless of the order of the arguments passed to ~loopy~.  As they are not
  loop commands, they cannot occur in sub-loops ([[*Sub-loops][Sub-loops]]).

  #+findex: with, let*
  - =with=, =let*=, =init= :: Declare variables before the loop.  This can also
    be used to initialize variables referenced by loop commands.

             (b (1+ a)))    ; Set `b' to 1+1=2.
       (list i '(1 2 3))    ; Bind `i' to elements of the list.
       (collect (+ i a b))) ; Collect sum of `a', `b', and each `i' into a list.

      ;; => 16
      (loopy
       (let* (my-sum 10))       ; Bind `my-sum' to 10.
       (list i '(1 2 3))        ; Bind `i' to elements of the list.
       (sum my-sum i)           ; Set `my-sum' to `i' + `my-sum'.

    #+end_src

  #+findex: finally-return
  - =finally-return= :: Return a value, regardless of how the loop completes.
    Accumulation commands have an implicit return value, but this argument
    overrides them.  Specifying multiple return values is the same as returning
    a list of those values.  This is convenient when used with ~seq-let~,
    ~pcase-let~, ~cl-destructuring-bind~, and the like.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; => "This string always returned."
      (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
             (when (cl-oddp i)

      ;; To be clear, the below code would be better expressed as

      ;;
      ;; => (1 2 3)

             (finally-return 1 2 3))
    #+end_src

  #+findex: flag, flags

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; Use Dash for destructuring:
      ;;
      ;; (((1 2) (3 4)) (1 3) (2 4))
      (loopy (flag dash)
             (list (whole &as a b) '((1 2) (3 4)))
             (collect wholes whole)
             (collect as a)

    #+end_src

  #+findex: wrap
  - =wrap= :: A list of forms in which to wrap the loop itself (i.e., not
    =before-do=, =after-do=, or anything else).  Each form can be either a list
    or a symbol.  If a list, the loop is inserted into the end of the list.  If
    a symbol, it is first converted to a list of 1 element before inserting the
    loop at the end of the list.  This special macro argument is similar in use
    to the Emacs Lisp macro ~thread-last~, except that forms listed first are
    applied last, as in normal Lisp code.

    The main difference between using this macro argument instead of just
    writing the function calls normally is that these forms can access variables
    initialized by the macro and that they occur after the code in =before-do=
    is run.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (loopy (wrap (let ((a 1)))
                   save-match-data)
             ...)

      (let ((a 1))
        (save-match-data
          (loopy ...)))

      ;; => 6
      (loopy (with (a 1))
             (before-do (cl-incf a 2))
             (wrap (progn (setq a (* 2 a))))
             (return a))
    #+end_src

  As stated above, all other expressions will be considered loop commands
  ([[#loop-commands][Loop Commands]]).


  #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Note
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  For convenience, the ~while~-loop that ~loopy~ creates is wrapped by a
  ~cl-block~.  Naming the loop names this block, which is created /after/
  initializing variables.

  The two special macro arguments =before-do= and =after-do= (and their aliases)
  also occur within this ~cl-block~, before and after the loop, respectively.
  This has 2 consequences:

  1. Using ~cl-return~ in =before-do= will prevent the both loop and =after-do=
     code from running.

  2. Using ~cl-return~ or an early exit command ([[#exiting-the-loop-early][Early Exit]]) in the loop will
     prevent the =after-do= code from running.  For this reason, =after-do= is
     run if and only if the loop completes successfully, hence the alias
     =else-do= and the similarity to Python's ~else~ statement for loops.

  These three sections (=before-do=, =after-do=, and the ~while~-loop itself)
  are the only structures that occur within the ~cl-block~.  Using ~cl-return~
  in =before-do=, for example, will not stop code in =finally-do= from running
  or values listed in =finally-return= from being returned.
  #+END_QUOTE

* Loop Commands
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: loop-commands
  :DESCRIPTION: The main features of `loopy'.
  :END:

  #+cindex: loop command
  If a macro argument does not match one of the previously listed special macro
  arguments ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]), ~loopy~ will attempt to treat it as a
  loop command.  Loop commands are only valid as a top-level argument to the
  macro, or inside another loop command.

  Therefore, these macro calls are valid:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
           (collect coll i)
           ;; Special macro argument:
           (finally-return coll))

    ;; Implicit accumulation variable and implicit return value:
    (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
           (collect i))
  #+END_SRC

  and this is not:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (loopy (with (list i '(1 2 3)))
           (finally-return (collect coll i)))
  #+END_SRC

  Trying to use loop commands where they don't belong will result in errors
  when the code is evaluated.

  You should keep in mind that commands are evaluated in order.  This means that
  attempting to do something like the below example might not do what you
  expect, as =i= is assigned a value from the list after collecting =i= into
  =coll=.

  #+caption: An example of how loop commands are evaluated in order.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; => (nil 1 2)
    (loopy (collect coll i)
           (list i '(1 2 3))
           (finally-return coll))
  #+END_SRC

  For convenience and understanding, the same command might have multiple names,
  called {{{dfn(aliases)}}}.  For example, the command =expr= has an alias
  =set=, because =expr= is used to set a variable to the value of an expression.
  You can add custom aliases using the function ~loopy-defalias~, which modifies
  the user option ~loopy-command-aliases~ ([[#custom-aliases][Custom Aliases]]).

  Some commands take optional arguments.  For example, the command =list= can
  take a function as an optional argument, which affects how that iterates
  through the elements in the list.

  For simplicity, the commands are described using the following notation:

  - If a command has multiple names, the names are separated by a vertical
    bar, such as in =expr|set=.
  - =VAR= is an unquoted symbol that will be used as a variable name, such as
    =i= in =(list i my-list)=.
  - =FUNC= is a quoted Lisp function name, such as ~#'my-func~ or ~'my-func~, a
    variable whose value is a function, or a ~lambda~ expression.
  - =NAME= is an unquoted name of a loop (or, more accurately, of a
    =cl-block=).
  - =EXPR= is a single Lisp expression, such as =(+ 1 2)=, ='(1 2 3)=,
    =my-var=, or =(some-function my-var)=.  =EXPRS= means multiple expressions.
    Really, we are concerned with the value of the expression, not the
    expression itself.
  - =CMD= is a loop command, as opposed to a normal Lisp expression.
    =(list i '(1 2 3))=, =(repeat 5)=, and =(return-from outer-loop 7)=
    are examples of loop commands.  =CMDS= means multiple commands.
  - Optional arguments are surround by brackets.  =[EXPR]= is an optional
    expression, and =[CMD]= is an optional command.  By extension,
    =[EXPRS]= is equivalent to =[EXPR [EXPR [...]]]=, and =[CMDS]= to
    =[CMD [CMD [...]]]=.
  - Optional keyword arguments are shown as =&key key1 key2 ...=, where =key1=,
    =key2=, and so on are the literal keywords.  Just like in functions,
    keywords must be prefixed by a colon (":").  For example, the iteration
    command =nums= has a keyword argument =by=, which can be given a value using
    =:by SOME-EXPRESSION=.


  Generally, =VAR= is initialized to ~nil~, but not always.  This document
  tries to note when that is not the case.

  #+cindex: variable destructuring
  For convenience, =VAR= can be a sequence, either a list or a vector (as a
  stand-in for an array), of symbols instead of a single symbol.  This tells
  the command to “de-structure” the value of =EXPR=, similar to the functions
  ~seq-let~, ~cl-destructuring-bind~, and ~pcase-let~.  This sequence of

  not all kinds of destructuring make sense in all situations.

     If =INIT= is provided, use that as the initial value of =VAR=.  This could
     also be achieved by specifying a value using the =with= special macro
     argument.  When destructuring, each variable is initialized to =INIT=, not
     a destructured part of =INIT=.

     #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Note
     #+begin_quote
     =expr= does /not/ behave the same as ~setq~ in all situations.

     While =expr= can take multiple arguments, it only assigns the value of one
     expression to one variable during each iteration of the loop (unless using
     destructuring).  It cannot take pairs of variables and values in the same
     way that ~setq~ does.

     Furthermore, variables assigned by =expr= (and other commands) are by
     default ~let~-bound around the loop and generally initialized to ~nil~.
     This means that doing =(expr VAR EXPR)= will not, by default, affect
     variables outside of the loop in the same way that using =(do (setq VAR
     EXPR))= would.

** Iteration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: iteration-and-looping-commands
   :DESCRIPTION: Iterating through sequences, etc.
   :END:

   Iteration commands bind local variables and determine when the loop ends.  If
   no command sets an ending condition, then the loop runs forever.  Infinite
   loops can be exited by using early-exit commands ([[#exiting-the-loop-early]]) or
   boolean commands ([[#boolean-commands]]).

   Iteration commands must occur in the top level of the ~loopy~ form or in a
   =sub-loop= command.  Trying to do something like the below will signal an
   error.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3 4 5))
            (when (cl-evenp i)
              ;; Can't use `list' in a `when'.
              ;; Will signal an error.
              (list j '(6 7 8 9 10))
              (collect j)))
   #+end_src


   In ~loopy~, iteration commands are named after what they iterate through.
   For example, the =array= and =list= commands iterate through the elements of
   arrays and lists, respectively.  For the sake of familiarity, these commands
   also have aliases based on their equivalent =for=-clause from ~cl-loop~.  To
   translate =for VAR in LIST= from ~cl-loop~, one can use either
   =(list VAR LIST)= or =(in VAR LIST)=.


*** Generic Iteration

        (loopy (repeat 3)
               (do (message "Messaged three times.")))

        (loopy (repeat i 3)

      #+END_SRC



*** Numeric Iteration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: numeric-iteration
    :DESCRIPTION: Iterating through numbers.
    :END:

    For iterating through numbers, there is the general =nums= command, and its
    variants =nums-up= and =nums-down=.

    #+findex: num, nums, number, numbers
    - =(nums|num|number|numbers VAR [START [END]] &key KEYS)= :: Iterate through
      numbers.  =KEYS= is one or several of =from=, =upfrom=, =downfrom=, =to=,
      =upto=, =downto=, =above=, =below=, and =by=.

      The command =nums= is used to iterate through numbers.  For example, =(nums
      i 1 10)= is similar to =(list i (number-sequence 1 10))=, and =(nums i 3)=
      is similar to =(expr i 3 (1+ i))=.

      To balance convenience and similarity to other commands, =nums= has a
      flexible argument list.  In its most basic form, it uses no keywords and
      takes a starting value and an ending value.  The ending value is inclusive.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => (1 2 3 4 5)
        (loopy (nums i 1 5)
               (collect i))
      #+end_src

      If the ending value is not given, then the value is incremented by 1
      without end.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => (7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16)
        (loopy (repeat 10)
               (nums i 7)
               (collect i))
      #+end_src

      To specify the step size, one can use the keyword =:by=.  The step size
      argument should always be positive.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => (1 3 5)
        (loopy (nums i 1 5 :by 2)
               (collect i))

        ;; => (7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25)
        (loopy (repeat 10)
               (nums i 7 :by 2)
               (collect i))

        ;; => (1 2.5 4.0)
        (loopy (nums i 1 5 :by 1.5)
               (collect i))
      #+end_src

      By default, the variable's value starts at 0 and increases by 1.  To
      specify that the value should be increasing or decreasing, one can use the
      keywords =:downfrom=, =:downto=, =:upfrom=, and =:upto=.  The keywords
      =:from= and =:to= don't by themselves specify a direction.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => (3 2 1)
        (loopy (repeat 3)
               (nums i :downfrom 3)
               (collect i))

        ;; => (0 -1 -2 -3)
        (loopy (nums i :downto -3)
               (collect i))

        ;; => (10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2)
        (loopy (nums i :downfrom 10 :to 2)
               (collect i))

        ;; => (10 8 6 4 2)
        (loopy (nums i :from 10 :downto 2 :by 2)
               (collect i))

        ;; => (1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
        (loopy (nums i :from 1 :upto 7)
               (collect i))
      #+end_src

      To specify an /exclusive/ ending value, use the keywords =:below= for
      increasing values and =:above= for decreasing values.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
        (loopy (nums i :from 1 :below 10)
               (collect i))

        ;; Same as
        (loopy (expr i 1 (1+ i))
               (while (< i 10))
               (collect i))

        ;; => (10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2)
        (loopy (nums i :from 10 :above 1)
               (collect i))

        ;; => (0 -1 -2)
        (loopy (nums i :above -3)
               (collect i))
      #+end_src


    If you prefer using positional arguments to keyword arguments, you can use
    the commands =nums-up= and =nums-down= to specify directions.  These
    commands are simple wrappers of the above =nums= command.

    #+findix: nums-down, numbers-down
    - =(nums-down|numsdown|numbers-down VAR START [END] &key by)= :: Equivalent
      to =(nums VAR START [:downto END] &key by)=.  This command exists only for

      #+end_src

    #+findix: nums-up, numbers-up
    - =(nums-up|numsup|numbers-up VAR START [END] &key by)= :: Equivalent to

*** Sequence Iteration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sequence-iteration
    :DESCRIPTION: Iterating through sequences.
    :END:

    These commands provide various ways to iterate through sequences
    ([[info:elisp#Sequences Arrays Vectors]]).

    #+cindex: sequence element distribution
    Instead of just one sequence, the =array=, =list=, and =seq= commands can be
    given multiple sequences of various sizes.  In such cases, the elements of
    the sequences are {{{dfn(distributed)}}}, like in the distributive property
    from mathematics.  A new sequence of distributed elements is created before
    the loop runs, and that sequence is used for iteration instead of the source
    sequences.  As seen in the below example, the resulting behavior is similar
    to that of nested loops.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; => ((1 3 6) (1 4 6) (1 5 6) (2 3 6) (2 4 6) (2 5 6))
      (loopy (list i '(1 2) '(3 4 5) '(6))
             (collect i))

      ;; Gives the same result as this
      (let ((result nil))
        (dolist (i '(1 2))
          (dolist (j '(3 4 5))
            (dolist (k '(6))
              (push (list i j k) result))))
        (nreverse result))

      ;; and this
      (cl-loop for i in '(1 2)
               append (cl-loop for j in '(3 4 5)
                               append (cl-loop for k in '(6)
                                               collect (list i j k))))
    #+end_src


    The =array= and =sequence= commands can use the same keywords as the =nums=
    command ([[#numeric-iteration]]) for working with the index and choosing a range
    of the sequence elements through which to iterate.  In addition to those
    keywords, they also have an =index= keyword, which names the variable used
    to store the accessed index during the loop.

    Keep in mind that if used with sequence distribution, these keywords affect
    iterating through the sequence of distributed elements.  That is, they do
    not affect how said sequence is produced.  In the example below, see that
    ~cddr~ is applied to the sequence of distributed elements. It is /not/
    applied to the source sequences.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; This code creates the sequence of distributed elements
      ;; ((1 4) (1 5) (1 6) (2 4) (2 5) (2 6) (3 4) (3 5) (3 6))
      ;; and then moves through this sequence using `cddr'.
      ;;
      ;; => ((1 4) (1 6) (2 5) (3 4) (3 6))
      (loopy (list i '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) :by #'cddr)
             (collect i))

      ;; Not the same as:
      ;; => ((1 4) (1 6) (3 4) (3 6))
      (loopy (list i '(1 3) '(4 6))
             (collect i))
    #+end_src


    #+findex: array, string, across
    - =(array|string|across VAR EXPR [EXPRS] &key KEYS)= :: Loop through the
      elements of the array =EXPR=.  In Emacs Lisp, strings are arrays whose

      =downto=, =above=, =below=, =by=, and =index=.  =index= names the variable

      command.

      If multiple arrays are given, then the elements of these arrays are
      distributed into an array of lists and the above keywords apply to this
      new resulting array.

      In each dotted pair assigned to =VAR=, the first element is the key and

      These pairs are created before the loop begins.  In other words, the map

*** Sequence Index Iteration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sequence-index-iteration
    :DESCRIPTION: Iterating through indices without accessing values.
    :END:

    This command is for iterating the a sequence's indices without accessing the
    actual values of that sequence.  This is helpful if you know ahead of time
    that you are only interested in a small subset of the sequence's elements.

    As with the =array= and =seq= commands, the =seq-index= command can use the
    same keywords as the =nums= command ([[#numeric-iteration]]) for working with
    the index and choosing a range of the sequence elements through which to
    iterate.  In addition to those keywords, it also has an =index= keyword,
    which names the variable used to store the accessed index during the loop.

    #+findex: seq-index, seqi, array-index, arrayi, list-index, listi, string-index, stringi
    - =(seq-index|array-index|list-index|string-index VAR VAL &key KEYS)= :: Iterate
      through the indices of =VAL=.

      =KEYS= is one or several of =from=, =upfrom=, =downfrom=, =to=, =upto=,
      =downto=, =above=, =below=, and =by=.  For their meaning, see the =nums=
      command.  This command is very similar to =nums=, except that it can
      automatically end the loop when the final element is reached.  With
      =nums=, one would first need to explicitly calculate the length of the
      sequence.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => (97 98 99 100 101 102)
        (loopy (with (my-string "abcdef"))
               (string-index idx my-string)
               (collect (aref my-string idx)))

        ;; Works the same as
        (loopy (with (my-string "abcdef"))
               (nums idx :from 0 :below (length my-string))
               (collect (aref my-string idx)))
      #+end_src

      For convenience, this command also has the aliases =seqi=, =arrayi=,
      =listi=, and =stringi=, analogous to the command aliases =seqf=, =arrayf=,
      =listf=, and =stringf=.

      This command does not support destructuring.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => (0 1 2)

               (seq-index idx my-seq :from 8 :downto 1 :by 2)

*** Sequence Reference Iteration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sequence-reference-iteration
    :DESCRIPTION: Iterating through places/fields in sequences.
    :END:

    These commands all iterate through ~setf~-able places as generalized
    variables ([[info:elisp#Generalized Variables]]).  These generalized variables
    are commonly called "references", "fields", or "places".  The below example
    demonstrates using ~(nth 1 my-list)~ and ~(aref my-array 1)~ as ~setf~-able
    places.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; => (1 99 3 4 5)
      (let ((my-list '(1 2 3 4 5)))

      ;; => [(1 2 3) (4 . 99)]
      (let ((my-array [(1 2 3) (4 5 6)]))
        (setf (cdr (aref my-array 1)) 99)
        my-array)
    #+end_src

    Like other commands, field/reference commands can also use destructuring, in
    which case the fields/places of the sequence are destructured into
    "sub-fields", like the ~cdr~ of the second array element in the example
    above.

    As with the =array= and =seq= commands, the =array-ref= and =seq-ref=
    commands can use the same keywords as the =nums= command
    ([[#numeric-iteration]]) for working with the index and choosing a range of the
    sequence elements through which to iterate.  In addition to those keywords,
    they also have an =index= keyword, which names the variable used to store
    the accessed index during the loop.

** Accumulation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: accumulation-commands
   :DESCRIPTION: Accumulating values into new sequences, aggregating values, etc.
   :END:

   Accumulation commands are used to accumulate or aggregate values into a
   variable, such as creating a list of values or summing the elements in
   a sequence.

   If needed, you can refer to the same accumulation variable in multiple
   accumulation commands.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 6 2 7 3 8)
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect coll i)
            (collect coll (+ i 5))
            (finally-return coll))
   #+end_src

   Like with other loop commands, variables created by accumulation commands
   (such as =coll= in the above example) are initialized to ~nil~ unless
   stated otherwise.

   #+cindex: accumulation destructuring
   Similar to iteration commands, accumulation commands can also use
   destructuring.  In accumulation commands, the values resulting from
   destructuring are accumulated, instead of the destructured value.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (collect (coll1 coll2 coll3) elem)
            (finally-return coll1 coll2 coll3))

     ;; => (5 7 9)
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (sum (sum1 sum2 sum3) elem)
            (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3))

     ;; Returns the same values as above.
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (expr sum1 (cl-first elem)  (+ sum1 (cl-first elem)))
            (expr sum2 (cl-second elem) (+ sum2 (cl-second elem)))
            (expr sum3 (cl-third elem)  (+ sum3 (cl-third elem)))
            (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3))
   #+end_src


   #+cindex: implied/implicit accumulation results
   #+vindex: loopy-result
   Like in ~cl-loop~, you do not need to supply a variable name to accumulation
   commands.  If no accumulation variable is given, accumulation commands will
   use the variable ~loopy-result~.  This variable is accessible in the
   =after-do=, =finally-do=, and =finally-return= special macro arguments.  You
   should not attempt to modify this variable.  If you wish to override what
   would be returned by the macro, simply use the =finally-return= macro
   argument as you normally would.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 2 3)
     (cl-assert (equal (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (after-do (cl-return loopy-result)))

                       (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (finally-return loopy-result))))

     ;; => (0 1 2 3)
     (cl-assert (equal (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (else-do (push 0 loopy-result)
                                       (cl-return loopy-result)))
                       (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (finally-do (push 0 loopy-result))
                              (finally-return loopy-result))))
   #+end_src

   #+cindex: implied/implicit return values
   Using an accumulation command without naming a variable implies a return
   value for the macro, which you can override using the =return= and
   =return-from= loop commands or the =finally-return= macro argument.  Be aware
   that that explicitly named accumulation variables do not affect this implied
   return value.  This limitation is needed for more consistently handling the
   complexity that comes from allowing the use of Pcase's arbitrary
   destructuring macros, and may change in the future.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 2 3)
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i))

     ;; => (1 2 3)
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i)
            (collect my-other-collection (* 2 i))
            (collect (a b) (list i (* 2 i))))
   #+end_src

   Therefore, when mixing implicit and explicit accumulation variables, you must
   use the =finally-return= special macro argument to return all of the
   accumulation results.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => ((1 2 3) (2 4 6) (1 2 3) (2 4 6))
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i)
            (collect my-other-collection (* 2 i))
            (collect (a b) (list i (* 2 i)))
            (finally-return loopy-result
                            my-other-collection
                            a b))
   #+end_src

   Like in ~cl-loop~, all accumulation commands using implied variables will
   accumulate into the same implied variable (that is, into ~loopy-result~).  An
   error will be signaled if the accumulation commands are not compatible.  For
   example, you should not try to accumulate =collect= results and =sum= results
   into ~loopy-result~, as trying to use a list as a number will cause an error.
   If you want to collect into separate variables, just specify a variable name
   like you normally would.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (3 2 1 11 12 13)
     (loopy (nums i 1 3)
            (collect i :at start)
            (collect (+ i 10) :at end))
   #+end_src

   #+attr_texinfo: :tag Warning
   #+begin_quote
   You should not try to access implied accumulation results (e.g.,
   ~loopy-result~) while the loop is running.  Implied results are only required
   to be correct after the loop ends (before code in =else-do= is run), allowing
   for more efficient code.

   Furthermore, because using a =return= or =return-from= command overrides
   implied return values, using these commands can prevent implied accumulation
   results from being finalized.  Using the =leave= command, which exits the
   loop without returning a value, does not affect the correctness of implied
   results.
   #+end_quote

   You should prefer using implied variables with accumulation commands whenever
   you can.  If you do not need access to accumulation variables while the loop
   is running, then there is no point in requesting that ~loopy~ generate code
   to allow that possibility.  Because ~loopy~ has more freedom in working with
   implied accumulation variables, their use can be much faster.

   By default, one must specify accumulation variables in order to accumulate
   into separate values.  As noted above, ~loopy~ will allow access to these
   variables during the loop, which requires a reduction in speed.  To have
   separate commands accumulate into separate variables while avoiding this
   reduction, one can use the =split= flag ([[#flags][Flags]]).

   When the flag is enabled and after the loop completes, each of these split
   accumulation variables will be part of the list ~loopy-result~, appearing in
   the same order as their respective commands in the macro's arguments.  In the
   example below, note that the result of ~(collect i)~ is the first element of
   ~loopy-result~, even though the collection happens /after/ the first
   summation when the loop runs.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => ((2 4) 15)

   Using this behavior can produce results much faster than destructuring
   accumulation commands.

   #+end_src

   To be clear, the more guarantees that can be made about the accumulation
   variables, the more ~loopy~ can optimize the accumulations.  The fastest
   accumulations (from greatest speed to least), are produced by:
   1. Using implied result variables with the =split= flag enabled.
   2. Using the implied variable ~loopy-result~, which, similar to the variables
      in (1), cannot be modified during the loop except by other accumulation
      commands.  This is the default behavior for accumulation commands that do
      not name a variable, and occurs when the =split= flag is disabled.
   3. Using explicitly named result variables, which can be modified during the
      loop by arbitrary code, not just accumulation commands.  This includes the
      explicitly named variables required for destructuring.

   Effort has gone into making each case efficient while keeping flexibility and
   correctness.  The difference in speed can be significant when working with
   large sequences or performing many accumulations.

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword arguments
   Some accumulation commands have optional keyword parameters, which are listed
   in the command's definition.  To avoid repetition, the common parameters are
   all described below.

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword at
   - =at= :: Where to place a value.  One of =end=, =start=, or =beginning=
     (equivalent to =start=).  If ungiven, defaults to =end=.  These positions
     need not be quoted.
   #+cindex: accumulation keyword into
   - =into= :: An alternative way to specify the variable into which to
     accumulate values.  One would normally just give =VAR= as the first
     argument of the loop command, but if you wish, you can use this keyword
     argument for a more ~cl-loop~-like syntax.

     As all accumulation commands support this keyword, it is not listed in
     any command definition.
   #+cindex: accumulation keyword test
   - =test= :: A function of two arguments, usually used to test for equality.
     Most tests default to ~eql~, as in Common Lisp and the =cl-lib= library.
   #+cindex: accumulation keyword key
   - =key= :: A function of one argument, used to transform the inputs of
     =test=.
   #+cindex: accumulation keyword init
   - =init= :: The initial value of =VAR=.  For explicitly named variables, one
     can use this argument or the =with= special macro argument.  When using the
     =split= flag, this argument is the only way to specify a non-default
     initial value.
   #+cindex: accumulation keyword result-type
   - =result-type= :: A sequence type into which =VAR= is converted /after the
     loop is over/.  These types need not be quoted.  For example, ='vector= and
     =vector= are both valid ways to specify the data type vector.

     This argument can be more convenient than writing out a call to ~cl-coerce~
     or ~seq-into~.

   The arguments to the =test= and =key= parameters can be quoted functions or
   variables, just like when using ~cl-union~, ~cl-adjoin~, and so on.  ~loopy~
   knows how to expand efficiently for either case.

   #+attr_texinfo: :tag Note
   #+begin_quote
   You will notice that each accumulation command has an alias of the command
   name in the present participle form (the "-ing" form).

   For example, instead of "min" or "minimize", you can use "minning" or
   "minimizing".  Instead of "sum" and "append", you can use "summing" and
   "appending".  This helps to avoid name collisions when using the ~loopy-iter~
   macro with the =lax-naming= flag enabled ([[#loopy-iter][The ~loopy-iter~ Macro]]).

** Boolean
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: boolean-commands
   :DESCRIPTION: Testing whether a condition holds true.
   :END:

   Boolean commands are used to test whether a condition holds true for elements
   of a sequence.  Under certain conditions, they cause the loop to exit and
   return a value.  Like accumulation commands, they have an implicit return
   value which is used if these commands do not cause the loop to exit.

   It is incorrect to use both =thereis= and one of =always= or =never= in the
   same loop, as this leads to conflicting implicit return values.

   For convenience, these commands can be passed multiple conditions.

   #+findex: always
   - =(always COND [CONDS])= :: Immediately return ~nil~ if any =COND= is ever
     ~nil~.  Otherwise, the loop returns the final value of the last =COND= or

** Sub-loops
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Running a loop within a loop.

   #+findex: sub-loop, subloop, loop
   - =(sub-loop|subloop|loop [CMDS])= :: Create a sub-loop in the same lexical
     environment as the top-level loop.


   There are two main ways to have a sub-loop in ~loopy~:

   1. Use another ~loopy~ call in a =do= command.
   2. Use the =sub-loop= (aliases =loop= and =subloop=) command.

   =sub-loop= is better for accumulating into variables, as is does not create
   its own result variable (unlike calling ~loopy~ again).  When using the
   =sub-loop= command, keep in mind the following:

   1. Only loop commands are valid within a sub-loop, not special macro
      arguments like =with= or =finally-return=.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; GOOD:
        ;; => (8 9 10)
        (loopy (with (a 7))
               (repeat 1)
               (loop (list i '(1 2 3))
                     (collect (+ a i))))

        ;; BAD:
        (loopy (repeat 1)
               (loop (with (a 7))
                     (list i '(1 2 3))
                     (collect (+ a i))))
      #+end_src

   2. Sub-loops can be named, but they do not have their own return value. The
      default loop name in ~loopy~ is ~nil~ for the top-level loop, but not for
      sub-loops.  To return from the outer loop, you can use =return-from=.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; Return from inner1 so never reach 4.
        ;; => ((3 5) (3 5))
        (loopy (repeat 2)
               (loop inner1
                     (list j '(3 4))
                     (loop (list k '(5 6 7))
                           (if (= k 6)
                               (return-from inner1)
                             (collect (list j k))))))

        ;; Can use `return-from' on `nil' to refer to the
        ;; top-level loop, if un-named. Otherwise use the name.
        (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
               (loop (list j '(5 4 3))
                     (if (= i j)
                         (return-from nil i)
                       (collect (cons i j)))))
      #+end_src

      Because there is no return value for sub-loops, the =return= and =leave=
      commands behave similarly.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => ((1 .6) (2 . 6))
        (loopy (list i '(1 2))
               (loop (list j '(6 7 8))
                     (if (= j 7)
                         (return)
                       (collect (cons i j)))))

        ;; => ((1 .6) (2 . 6))
        (loopy (list i '(1 2))
               (loop (list j '(6 7 8))
                     (if (= j 7)
                         (leave)
                       (collect (cons i j)))))
      #+end_src

   3. Variables used for iteration can be local to a sub-loop, but not
      variables used for accumulation.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; GOOD:
        ;; => (0 1 2 3 1 2 3)
        (loopy (repeat 2)
               (loop (list i '(1 2 3))
                     (collect my-coll i))
               (finally-return (cons 0 my-coll)))

        ;; BAD:
        ;; Would not give (0 3 3).  Instead, signals error.
        (loopy (repeat 2)
               (loop (list i '(1 2 3)))
               ;; Error:  `i' doesn't exist outside the sub-loop:
               (collect my-coll i)
               (finally-return (cons 0 my-coll)))
      #+end_src

* Special Variables

  Beyond loop commands, there are a few special variables that one can use
  inside of the loop.

  #+vindex: loopy-first-iteration
  - =loopy-first-iteration= :: Whether the current loop is in its first
    iteration.

    #+attr_texinfo: :tag Warning

* The ~loopy-iter~ Macro
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: loopy-iter
  :DESCRIPTION: Embedding loop commands in arbitrary code.
  :END:

  #+cindex: loopy-iter
  #+findex: loopy-iter
  ~loopy-iter~ is a macro that allows for the embedding of loop commands inside
  arbitrary code, instead of trying to use the =do= loop command to embed
  arbitrary code in a loop.  You must use ~require~ to load this feature.

  #+attr_texinfo: :tag Warning
  #+begin_quote
  *This feature is still experimental.*  It might not work correctly in all
  circumstances.
  #+end_quote

  This macro is meant to be conceptually similar to the ~iterate~ or ~iter~
  macro provided by the Common Lisp package "Iterate" [fn:iter] (not to be
  confused with the ~iter-*~ functions provided by Emacs).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'loopy-iter) ; <- Must `require' to load feature.

    ;; => (2 4 6)
    (loopy-iter (for list i '(1 2 3))
                (let ((a (* 2 i)))
                  (accum collect a)))
  #+end_src

  #+cindex: loopy-iter keywords
  #+vindex: loopy-iter-command-keywords
  To clearly distinguish between loop commands and Emacs features (such as the
  loop command =list= and the function ~list~), a loop command must be preceded
  by one of the keywords =for=, =accum=, or =exit=.  These keywords do not share
  a name with any built-in Emacs feature and are similar to the keywords used by
  other packages.  For example, =(list VAR LIST)= would be =(for list VAR LIST)=
  or =(for in VAR LIST)=.

  Any keyword in the user option ~loopy-iter-command-keywords~ can be used to
  identify any loop command.  For example, =(accum collect a)= and
  =(for collect a)= are both valid ways of referring to the =collect= loop
  command in ~loopy-iter~.

  To disable this requirement, use the flag =lax-naming= ([[#flags][Using Flags]]).  When
  using =lax-naming=, ~loopy-iter~ will always prefer built-in features to loop
  commands.  For example, "list" will always be understood as referring to the
  function ~list~ and not the loop command =list=.

  #+vindex: loopy-iter-ignored-commands
  If for some reason you wish for ~loopy-iter~ to ignore a loop command while
  using =lax-naming=, you can add that symbol to ~loopy-iter-ignored-commands~.

  Special macro arguments, already having clearly distinguishable names, do not
  need to be preceded by one of the above keywords.  However, some aliases (such
  as =let*= for =with=) will not work in ~loopy-iter~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((1 8) (2 9) (3 10))
    (loopy-iter (with (a 7))                ; <- Set once around loop.
                (for list elem '(1 2 3))
                (let* ((c elem)             ; <- These set inside of loop.
                       (d (+ a c)))
                  (accum collect (list c d))))
  #+end_src

  Restrictions on the placement of loop commands and special macro arguments
  still apply in ~loopy-iter~.  For example, iteration commands must still occur
  at the top level of ~loopy-iter~ or a sub-loop.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

                           (for expr j 8 (1+ j))
                           (when (> j 12)
                             ;; Leave loop but don't force return value,
                             ;; allowing implicit result to be returned.
                             (exit leave))
                           j)))
                  (accum collect a)))
  #+end_src

  You should not rely on the values of the code into which loop commands
  translate.  For example, the above usage of =expr= might become a ~setq~ form,
  but that is an implementation detail and subject to change.  Best practice is
  to instead use a variable as the last expression in a ~progn~ form.

  For convenience, ~loopy-iter~ will not attempt to interpret loop commands in
  quoted code, except in sharp-quoted ~lambda~ forms.  This is because the
  ~lambda~ macro is self-quoting, and so Emacs might quote the form before it is
  seen by ~loopy-iter~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (1 2 3)
    (loopy-iter (for list elem '(1 2 3))
                (funcall (lambda (x)
                           (accum collect x))
                         elem))

    ;; => (1 2 3)
    (loopy-iter (for list elem '(1 2 3))
                (funcall #'(lambda (x) ; <- sharp-quoted, but still interpreted
                             (accum collect x))
                         elem))
  #+end_src

  #+attr_texinfo: :tag Note
  #+begin_quote
  Nesting arbitrary code in the loop requires knowing how to understand the
  code.  You might find cases where ~loopy-iter~ interprets code incorrectly.

  Please report such cases on this project's [[https://github.com/okamsn/loopy/issues][issues tracker]].
  #+end_quote

  ~loopy~ (and so ~loopy-iter~) does not currently have all of the features of
  Common Lisp's ~iter~ macro.  Think of it more as a way to use loop commands
  embedded in arbitrary code.


* Using Flags
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: flags
  :DESCRIPTION: Using flags to change behavior.
  :END:

  #+cindex: flag
  A "flag" is a symbol passed to the =flag= or =flags= special macro argument,
  and changes the macro's behavior.  Currently, flags affect what ~loopy~ uses
  to perform destructuring (~pcase-let~, ~seq-let~, =dash=, or the default
  method) and whether accumulation commands that don't specify a variable (such
  as =(collect collect-value)=) accumulate into one or several variables.

  Flags are applied in order, so if you specify =(flags seq pcase)= ~loopy~ will
  use ~pcase-let~ for destructuring, not ~seq-let~.

  #+vindex: loopy-default-flags
  If you wish to always use a flag, you can add that flag to the list
  ~loopy-default-flags~.  These can be overridden by any flag given in the
  =flag= special macro argument.

  The following flags are currently supported:

  #+cindex: pcase flag
  - =pcase= :: Use ~pcase-let~ for destructuring
    ([[info:elisp#Destructuring with pcase Patterns]]).
  #+cindex: seq flag
  - =seq= :: Use ~seq-let~ for destructuring ([[info:elisp#seq-let]]).
  #+cindex: dash flag
  - =dash= :: Use the style of destructuring found in the =dash= library
   ([[info:dash#-let]]).
  #+cindex: split flag
  - =split= :: Make accumulation commands with implicit variables accumulate into
    separate variables which are then collected into ~loopy-result~.
  #+cindex: lax-naming flag
  - =lax-naming= :: In ~loopy-iter~, don't require keywords when using loop
    commands ([[#loopy-iter][The ~loopy-iter~ Macro]]).
  #+cindex: default flag
  - =default= :: Use the default behavior for all options.


  For convenience, all flags (except =default=) can be undone by prefixing them
  with =-= (a dash or minus sign), which reverts ~loopy~ to its default
  behavior.

  For example, if you have set ~loopy-default-flags~ to =(dash split)= and wish
  to only use the =split= flag for a loop, you can use either =(flags default
  split)= or, more simply, =(flag -dash)=.  These prefixed flags only apply when
  the unprefixed version is active.  That is, =(flags pcase -dash)= is the same
  as just =(flags pcase)=, regardless of the value of ~loopy-default-flags~, as
  =pcase= destructuring will override all uses of =dash= destructuring as it
  comes later in the list.  Similarly, =(flags -dash dash)= and =(flags -dash
  +dash)= leave =dash= destructuring enabled, and =(flags +dash -dash)= disables
  =dash= destructuring and uses the default behavior.

  #+cindex: loopy-dash
  #+cindex: loopy-pcase
  #+cindex: loopy-seq
  The destructuring flags (=pcase=, =seq=, and =dash=) are separate libraries
  (respectively, =loopy-pcase=, =loopy-seq=, and =loopy-dash=) that must be
  loaded after =loopy=.  Currently, =loopy-dash= is a separate package.

  Below are some example of using the destructuring flags.  These flags do not
  affect the destructuring of commands using generalized variables (i.e.,
  ~setf~-able places).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6))) ; whole
    ;;     (1 4)                 ; i
    ;;     (2 5)                 ; j
    ;;     (3 6))                ; k
    (require 'loopy-dash)
    (loopy (flag dash)
           (list elem '((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6))))
           (collect (whole &as i (j k)) elem)
           (finally-return whole i j k))

    ;; => ((1 4) (3 6))
    (require 'loopy-pcase)
    (loopy (flag pcase)
           (list elem '((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6))))
           (collect `(,a (,_ ,b)) elem)
           (finally-return a b))

    ;; => ((1 6) (3 8) ([4 5] [9 10]))
    (require 'loopy-seq)
    (loopy (flag seq)
           (list elem '([1 2 3 4 5] [6 7 8 9 10]))
           (collect [a _ b &rest c] elem)
           (finally-return a b c))
  #+end_src

  As noted in previous sections, the =split= flag can be used to generate more
  efficient code for accumulation commands ([[#accumulation-commands]]).  By making
  stronger guarantees about how accumulation variables can be used, ~loopy~ can
  produce results fasters.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Both of these example give the same result, but the latter
     ;; can expand into more efficient code.
     ;;
     ;; There is also the `push-into' command, which avoids this problem when
     ;; used with `nreverse'.

     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (collect (i j k) elem)
            (finally-return i j k))

     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
     (loopy (flag split) ; Don't accumulate into same implicit variable.
            (list (i j k) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (collect i)
            (collect j)
            (collect k))
   #+end_src

   Below is an example of the =split= flag.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 2 3 4 5)
     (loopy (flag -split)
            (list i '(1 2 3 4 5))
            (if (cl-oddp i)
                (collect i)
              (collect i))
            ;; This `finally-return' is unneeded.
            (finally-return loopy-result))

     ;; => ((1 3 5) (2 4))
     (loopy (flag split)
            (list i '(1 2 3 4 5))
            (if (cl-oddp i)
                (collect i)
              (collect i))
            ;; This `finally-return' is unneeded.
            (finally-return loopy-result))
   #+end_src


* Custom Aliases
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: custom-aliases
  :DESCRIPTION: How to add one's own aliases.
  :END:

  #+cindex: custom aliases
  An {{{dfn(alias)}}} is another name for a command.  ~loopy~ comes with several
  built-in aliases, such as =set= for the command =expr=.

  #+vindex: loopy-command-aliases
  #+findex: loopy-defalias
  Custom aliases can be added to the user option ~loopy-command-aliases~, which
  associates aliases with their true names.  For convenience, the macro
  ~loopy-defalias~ is provided, which will correctly add an association to
  this variable.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; You don't need to quote either argument,
    ;; but you can if you prefer.
    (loopy-defalias l list)
    (loopy-defalias a 'array)

    ;; => ((1 . 4) (2 . 5) (3 . 6))
    (loopy (l i '(1 2 3))
           (a j [4 5 6])
           (collect (cons i j)))

    ;; => ((a . array) (l . list))
    loopy-command-aliases
  #+end_src

  When looking for a command parser, =loopy= will always check whether a given
  name is an alias before checking whether it is a command.  Additionally,
  aliases can be recursive.  That is, you can create a new alias for an existing
  alias.

  Special macro arguments ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]) can also be aliased.  Using
  an alias does not change that the special macro arguments are parsed before
  loop commands.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (loopy-defalias as with)

    ;; => (8 9 10)
    (loopy (as (a 7))
           (list i '(1 2 3))
           (collect (+ i 7)))
  #+end_src


* Custom Commands
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: adding-custom-commands
  :DESCRIPTION: Extending `loopy' with personal commands.
  :END:

  This section contains information about how loop commands work and how one can
  add custom commands to ~loopy~.  Two examples are provided.

** Background Info
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background-info
   :DESCRIPTION: The internals of `loopy'.
   :END:

   #+cindex: instruction, instructions
   The core working of ~loopy~ is taking a loop command and generating code that
   becomes part of a ~while~-loop.  This code is represented by
   {{{dfn(instructions)}}}, which basically describe where and how code is
   inserted into/around a template of a ~while~-loop.

   Some examples of instructions are:
   - Declaring a given variable in a let form to make sure it's locally
     scoped.
   - Declaring a generated variable in a let form to contain a given value.
   - Adding a condition for continuing/exiting the loop.
   - Adding code to be run during the main processing section of the
     ~while~-loop.  This location is referred to as the {{{dfn(main body)}}} of
     the loop.
   - Adding code to be run after the main processing section, such as for
     updating variables.  This location is referred to as the {{{dfn(latter
     body)}}} of the loop.

   For example, parsing the command =(list i '(1 2 3))= produces the following
   list of instructions.  Some commands require the creation of unique temporary
   variables, such as =list-3717= in the below output.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ((loopy--iteration-vars (list-211 '(1 2 3)))
      (loopy--latter-body    (setq list-211 (cdr list-211)))
      (loopy--pre-conditions (consp list-211))
      (loopy--iteration-vars (i nil))
      (loopy--main-body      (setq i (car list-211))))
   #+END_SRC

   The first element of an instruction describes where to insert code into the
   template.  The second element of an instruction is said code to insert.  You
   can see that not all of the code to be inserted is a valid Lisp form.  For
   example, the above instruction referencing ~loopy--iteration-vars~ inserts
   a binding for the variable =i= into a ~let~-like form.

   | Place                   | Code                             |
   |-------------------------+----------------------------------|
   | =loopy--iteration-vars= | =(list-211 '(1 2 3))=            |
   | =loopy--latter-body=    | =(setq list-211 (cdr list-211))= |
   | =loopy--pre-conditions= | =(consp list-211)=               |
   | =loopy--iteration-vars= | =(i nil)=                        |
   | =loopy--main-body=      | =(setq i (car list-211)))=       |

   Commands are parsed by ~loopy--parse-loop-command~, which receives a command
   call, such as =(list i '(1 2 3))=, and returns a list of instructions.  It
   does this by searching for an appropriate command-specific parsing function
   in ~loopy-command-aliases~ and ultimately in ~loopy-command-parsers~.  For
   parsing multiple commands in order, there is ~loopy--parse-loop-commands~,
   which wraps the single-command version.

   For example, consider the function ~loopy--parse-if-command~, which parses
   the =if= loop command.  It needs to check the instructions of the
   sub-commands passed to =if=, looking for code that would be inserted into the
   main loop body (as determined by the first element of the instruction).  Once
   found, it wraps that code with an ~if~-form.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => ((loopy--iteration-vars (i nil))
     ;;     (loopy--main-body (setq i 1)))
     (loopy--parse-loop-command '(expr i 1))

     ;; => ((loopy--iteration-vars (i nil))
     ;;     (loopy--main-body (if (my-condition)
     ;;                           (setq i 1)
     ;;                         (setq i 2))))
     (loopy--parse-if-command '(if (my-condition)
                                   (expr i 1)
                                 (expr i 2)))
   #+end_src

   For the purpose of this example, below is a version of the parsing function
   made of the basic Lisp features with which you are familiar.  The actual
   definition makes use of more convenient Emacs Lisp libraries.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'loopy-commands)
     (defun loopy--parse-if-command (arg)
       "Parse the `if' loop command usage ARG.
     ARG is of the form (if CONDITION IF-TRUE &rest IF-FALSE)."

       (let ((condition (cadr arg))   ; Second element of `arg'.
             (if-true   (caddr arg))  ; Third element of `arg'.
             (if-false  (cdddr arg))) ; Remaining elements of `arg'.

         ;; The main processing of this function is to separate instructions
         ;; for the loop's main body from other instructions,
         ;; and to then wrap those main-body instructions with an
         ;; `if' special form.
         (let ((full-instructions)
               (if-true-main-body)
               (if-false-main-body)
               ;; This variable is just so that iteration commands know when
               ;; they are being used away from the top level of the loop's
               ;; structure (which is an error).
               (loopy--in-sub-level t))

           ;; Process the instructions for the command that should run if the
           ;; condition is true.
           (dolist (instruction (loopy--parse-loop-command if-true))
             (if (eq 'loopy--main-body (car instruction))
                 (push (cadr instruction) if-true-main-body)
               (push instruction full-instructions)))

           ;; Process the instructions for the commands that should run
           ;; if the condition is false.
           (dolist (instruction (loopy--parse-loop-commands if-false))
             (if (eq 'loopy--main-body (car instruction))
                 (push (cadr instruction) if-false-main-body)
               (push instruction full-instructions)))

           ;; Note: `push' adds elements to the front of a list,
           ;;       so we need to reverse these lists before returning
           ;;       the new list of instructions.

           ;; `loopy--parse-loop-command' always returns a list of instructions.
           ;; For some commands, that means wrapping multiple instructions in
           ;; a `progn' form.  For others, we need to extract the only element.
           (setq if-true-main-body
                 (if (= 1 (length if-true-main-body))
                     (car if-true-main-body)
                   (cons 'progn (nreverse if-true-main-body))))

           ;; Return the new, full list of instructions.
           (cons `(loopy--main-body
                   . (if ,condition
                         ,if-true-main-body
                       ,@(nreverse if-false-main-body)))
                 (nreverse full-instructions)))))
   #+END_SRC

   The hardest part of this exchange is making sure that the inserted code ends
   up in the correct order.

   A loop body command has 7 main places to put code:

   #+vindex: loopy--generalized-vars
   - =loopy--generalized-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and a macro
     expansion that will be given to =cl-symbol-macrolet=.  This is used to
     create named ~setf~-able places.  The expansion you use depends on the kind
     of sequence and how the it is updated.

     For example, =(list-ref i my-list)= declares =i= to be a symbol which
     expands to =(car TEMP-VAR)=, in which =TEMP-VAR= holds the value of
     =my-list=.  At the end of the loop body, =TEMP-VAR= is set to its =cdr=,
     ensuring that the next call to =car= returns the correct value.

   #+vindex: loopy--iteration-vars
   - =loopy--iteration-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and an expression that will be
     given to ~let*~.  This is used for initializing variables needed for
     iteration commands, such as the =i= in =(list i '(1 2 3))= or to store the
     list ='(1 2 3)= in =(list i '(1 2 3))=.  This also includes variables
     needed for destructuring.

   #+vindex: loopy--accumulation-vars
   - =loopy--accumulation-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and an expression that will
     be given to ~let*~.  This is used for initializing variables needed for
     accumulation commands, such as the =coll= in =(collect coll my-val)= or any
     variables needed for destructuring.

   #+vindex: loopy--pre-conditions
   - =loopy--pre-conditions= :: Expressions that determine if the =while=
     loop runs/continues, such as whether a list still has elements in it.
     If there is more than one expression, than all expressions are used in
     an =and= special form.

   #+vindex: loopy--main-body
   - =loopy--main-body= :: Expressions that make up the main body of the
     loop.

   #+vindex: loopy--latter-body
   - =loopy--latter-body= :: Expressions that need to be run after the main
     body, such as updating some of variables that determine when a loop ends.

   #+vindex: loopy--post-conditions
   - =loopy--post-conditions= :: Expressions that determine whether the
     =while= loop continues, but checked after the loop body has run.  The
     code from this is ultimately appended to the latter body before being
     substituted in.

   For accumulation commands, you might also wish to place values in the
   following:

   #+vindex: loopy--implicit-return
   - =loopy--implicit-return= :: A list of values to be returned by the loop if
     no other return value is specified/reached. A value is added to this list
     when an accumulation command does not specify an accumulation variable, and
     in some special other cases.

     By default, the implicit return value is ~loopy-result~, and so this
     variable is usually just a list of the symbol =loopy-result=.  When the
     =split= flag is enabled, this is a list of values to which ~loopy-result~
     is bound.

   #+vindex: loopy--accumulation-final-updates
   - =loopy--accumulation-final-updates= :: Actions to perform on the
     accumulation variable after the loop ends.  Some implied accumulation
     commands need to update the variable one final time after ending the loop.
     Some examples are:
     1. Correcting the order of elements in a list that was constructed in
        reverse.
     2. Coercing the variable into a new sequence type, for commands with the
        ~:result-type~ argument.

     Each accumulation variable can only be updated once, in a single way.  For
     example, a variable cannot be reversed according to the needs of one
     command and then coerced into a new type according to the needs of another.
     Commands acting on the same accumulation variable must require the same
     final update, if they require any final update.

   There are 4 more variables a loop command can push to, but they are derived
   from the macro's arguments.  Adding to them after using a macro argument
   might lead to unintended behavior.  You might wish to use them if, for
   example, you are concerned with what happens after the loop exits/completes.

   #+vindex: loopy--before-do
   - =loopy--before-do= :: Expressions to evaluate before the loop.  These are
     derived from the =before-do= macro argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--after-do
   - =loopy--after-do= :: Expressions to evaluate after the loop completes
     successfully.  These are derived from the =after-do= macro argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--final-do
   - =loopy--final-do= :: Expressions to evaluate after the loop completes,
     regardless of success.  These are derived from the =finally-do= macro
     argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--final-return
   - =loopy--final-return= :: An expression that is always returned by the
     macro, regardless of any early returns in the loop body.  This is
     derived from the =finally-return= macro argument.


   #+vindex: loopy--loop-name
   Some commands might depend on the name of the loop.  The symbol which names
   the loop is stored in the variable ~loopy--loop-name~.  The default value is
   ~nil~ for normal loop and uniquely generated for sub-loops created with the
   =sub-loop= command.

   The structure of the macro’s expanded code depends on the features used
   (e.g., ~loopy~ won’t try to declare variables if none exist), but the result

** Hello World
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-small-example
   :DESCRIPTION: A minimal working example.
   :END:

   To implement a custom loop body command, =loopy= needs two pieces of
   information:
   1. The keyword that names your command
   2. The parsing function that can turn uses of your command into instructions.

   Importantly, your custom commands cannot share a name.

   For example, say that you're tired of typing out
   =(do (message "Hello, %s" first last))= and would prefer to instead use
   =(greet FIRST [LAST])=.  This only requires pushing code into the main
   loopy body, so the definition of the parsing function is quite simple.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'cl-lib)
     (cl-defun my-loopy-greet-command-parser
         ((_ personal-name &optional family-name))
       "Greet one with PERSONAL-NAME and optional FAMILY-NAME."
       `((loopy--main-body (if ,family-name
                               (message "Hello, %s %s"
                                        ,personal-name ,family-name)
                             (message "Hello, %s" ,personal-name)))))
   #+END_SRC

   =loopy= will pass the entire command expression to the parsing function, and
   expects back a list of instructions.

   #+vindex: loopy-command-parsers
   To tell =loopy= about this function, add it and the command name =greet= to
   the variable =loopy-command-parsers=, which associates commands with parsing
   functions.  The function that is paired with the symbol receives the entire
   command expression, and should produce a list of valid instructions.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; Using the Map library, for convenience.
     (require 'map)
     (setf (map-elt loopy-command-parsers 'greet)
           #'my-loopy-greet-command-parser)
   #+END_SRC

   After that, you can use your custom command in the loop body.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (loopy (list name '(("John" "Deer") ("Jane" "Doe") ("Jimmy")))
            (greet (car name) (cadr name)))
   #+END_SRC

   By running {{{kbd(M-x pp-macroexpand-last-sexp RET)}}} on the above
   expression, you can see that it expands to do what we want, as expected.  You
   might notice that one shortcoming of the current definition is that if a
   function is used to produce the second argument, as in ~(greet
   (personal-name) (family-name))~, then that function is called twice.  This
   occurs with ~(cadr name)~ in the below output, and can cause problems when
   using stateful functions.  This particular case can be resolved by using
   ~if-let~ to first store the result of ~(cadr name)~, and is something to keep
   in mind when defining Lisp macro expansions in general.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; An example expansion.
     (let* ((list-166 '(("John" "Deer") ("Jane" "Doe") ("Jimmy")))
            (name nil))
       (let ((loopy-first-iteration t))
         (cl-block nil
           (while (consp list-166)
             (setq name (car list-166))
             (if (cadr name)
                 (message "Hello, %s %s"
                          (car name)
                          (cadr name))
               (message "Hello, %s"
                        (car name)))
             (setq list-166 (cdr list-166))
             (setq loopy-first-iteration nil))
           nil)))
   #+END_SRC

** An ~always~ Command
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: always-example
   :DESCRIPTION: Adding a feature from `cl-loop'.
   :END:

   Lets say we want to emulate ~cl-loop~'s =always= clause, which causes the
   loop to return ~nil~ if an expression evaluates to ~nil~ and ~t~ otherwise.
   This is similar to the functions ~cl-every~ and ~seq-every-p~.

   Here is an example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; => t
     (cl-loop for i from 1 to 9 always (< i 10))
   #+END_SRC

   While ~loopy~ already has an =always= command, we'll ignore it for the sake
   of this example.  Without a custom command, you could translate this using
   the following code:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; => t
     (loopy (nums i 1 9)
            (unless (< i 10) (return nil))
            (else-do (cl-return t)))
   #+END_SRC

   This is similar to what you might write in other languages, such as Python.

   #+begin_src python
     # In some testing Python function:
     for i in range(1, 10):
         if not (i < 10):
             return False
     else:
         return True
   #+end_src

   While the meaning of the code is clear, this approach is certainly wordier.

   Here's how one could do this using a custom command.  Again, =loopy= already
   comes with a built-in =always= command.  This example is taken directly from
   the file {{{file(loopy-commands.el)}}}, which contains the code of all of
   ~loopy~'s built-in parsers.

   We can describe the command's desired behavior in two sentences:
   1. The loop should immediately return ~nil~ if the expression ever evaluates
      to ~nil~.
   2. The loop should return ~t~ if the loop is able to complete successfully.

   This simplest way to satisfy the first requirement is to conditionally use
   ~cl-return~ if the expressions ever evaluates to ~nil~.  We want to do this
   while the loop is running, so we should use an instruction for
   ~loopy--main-body~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; We want to insert the below code into the loop
     (unless CONDITION
       (cl-return nil))

     ;; so we use the instruction
     `(loopy--main-body (unless ,CONDITION (cl-return nil)))

     ;; where CONDITION is supplied by the parsing function.
   #+end_src

   For a simple loop, this works well enough.  However, the function ~cl-return~
   only works with blocks that are named ~nil~.  If we have named the loop, then
   ~cl-return~ won't work, and might instead cause unexpected errors.
   Therefore, it is better to use ~cl-return-from~ with the variable
   ~loopy--loop-name~.  As noted in the previous section, ~loopy--loop-name~
   stores the symbol which names the loop.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     `(loopy--main-body (unless ,CONDITION
                          (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name nil)))
   #+end_src

   The best way to satisfy the second requirement is to use an instruction for
   ~loopy--implicit-return~.  One /could/ try to insert code using
   ~cl-return-from~ into ~loopy--after-do~, and this /would/ cause a value to be
   returned after the loop had successfully completed, but doing it that way
   could unexpectedly prevent other code in =after-do= from running.  Using an
   implicit return value does not have that problem.

   This gives us the following instruction, which will add ~t~ to the list of
   values the macro returns if nothing else would be returned.  If that list is
   just ~'(t)~, then the macro knows to just return ~t~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     '(loopy--implicit-return t)
   #+end_src

   Once we've chosen our instructions, we need to tell =loopy= what function to
   use to produce these instructions.  Like in the previous example, we define
   the parsing function and add it to ~loopy-command-parsers~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; As noted in the previous section, the parsing function is always
     ;; passed the entire command as `(always CONDTION)', not just the
     ;; command arguments as `CONDITION'.

     (cl-defun my--loopy-always-command-parser ((_ condition))
       "Parse a command of the form `(always CONDITION)'.

     If any condition is nil, `loopy' should immediately return nil.
     Otherwise, `loopy' should return t."
       `((loopy--implicit-return t)
         (loopy--main-body (unless ,condition
                             (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name nil)))))

     (setf (map-elt loopy-command-parsers 'always)
           #'my--loopy-always-command-parser)
   #+end_src

   Once we've added our parsing function to ~loopy-command-parsers~,
   =loopy= will use that function whenever it tries to understand the =always=
   command.  In this case, this custom parser would supercede the built-in
   parser.

   With that done, our custom =always= command is as useful as the corresponding
   ~cl-loop~ clause.  However, because ~loopy~ uses expressions instead of
   keyword clauses like ~cl-loop~, we can do slightly better.  For convenience,
   we can easily allow passing multiple conditions to the command instead of
   just one.  In such cases, the conditions should be wrapped in an ~and~ form,
   and that is indeed what the built-in parser does.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; The built-in parser, taken from `loopy-commands.el':
     (cl-defun loopy--parse-always-command ((_ &rest conditions))
       "Parse a command of the form `(always [CONDITIONS])'.

     If any condition is nil, `loopy' should immediately return nil.
     Otherwise, `loopy' should return t."
       `((loopy--implicit-return t)
         ;; If there are multiple conditions, wrap these conditions in `and'.
         (loopy--main-body (unless ,(if (= 1 (length conditions))
                                        (cl-first conditions)
                                      `(and ,@conditions))
                             (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name nil)))))
   #+end_src

   Here are some examples of the command in action:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; One condition: => t
     (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9)) (always (< i 10)))

     ;; Two conditions: => nil
     (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9))
            (list j '(2 4 6 8 9))
            (always (< i 10) (cl-evenp j)))

     ;; The previous example is equivalent to this.
     (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9))
            (list j '(2 4 6 8 9))
            (always (and (< i 10) (cl-evenp j))))
   #+end_src


** Finding More Examples
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: finding-more-examples
   :END:

   If you would like to see more examples, consider reading through the source
   code of {{{file(loopy-commands.el)}}}, which contains the code of all of the
   built-in loop commands.  You can easily find this file using
   {{{kbd(M-x find-library loopy-commands RET)}}}.

* Comparing to ~cl-loop~
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: comparing-to-cl-loop
  :DESCRIPTION: Why `loopy' instead of `cl-loop'.
  :END:

  ~loopy~ should be comparable with ~cl-loop~ for most things, keeping in
  mind the following:
  - It is probably less efficient than ~cl-loop~, though I am so far trying to
    keep the same logic that ~cl-loop~ uses.
  - It has more flexible control-flow commands, under which you can easily group
    sub-commands, including assignments.
  - It has a =skip= command to skip the rest of the loop body and immediately
    start the next iteration.  Of course, a similar effect could be achieved
    using the =when= or =unless= commands.

  ~loopy~ is not always one-to-one replacement for ~cl-loop~, but it is easy to
  use and extend, and performs well in the cases that it already handles.

  Below is a simple example of ~loopy~ vs ~cl-loop~.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'cl-lib)
    (cl-loop with some-thing = 5
             for i from 1 to 100
             do (message "I is %s" i)
             when (> (+ i 5) 20)
             return (format "Done: %d" i))

    (require 'loopy)
    (loopy (with (some-thing 5))
           (nums i 1 100)
           (do (message "I is %s" i))
           (when (> (+ i 5) 20)
             (return (format "Done: %d" i))))
  #+END_SRC

  The main benefit (I believe) of Loopy is clearer grouping of commands under
  conditionals while still using a clean syntax, such as in the below example.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; => '((2 4) (4 8) (6 12) (8 16) (10 20))
    (loopy (nums i 1 10)
           (when (cl-evenp i)
             (expr once i)
             (expr twice (* 2 i))
             (collect doubles (list once twice)))
           (finally-return doubles))
  #+END_SRC

  In my experience, ~cl-loop~ does not allow the easy grouping of assignment
  statements under a =when= condition.  For example, below is something I would
  like to try to do with ~cl-loop~.

  I am aware that in this example the =for= statements aren't necessary and that
  the =collect= statements would be sufficient, but (when I come across things
  like this in my work) I would like to use them to declare variables for
  readability purposes.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'cl-lib)
    (save-match-data
      (cl-loop with pattern = "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)"
               for line in (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2")
               when (string-match pattern line)
               for line-num = (concat "L" (match-string 1 line))
               and for data-num = (concat "D" (match-string 2 line))

               ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

               and collect line-num into line-nums
               and collect data-num into data-nums
               finally return (list line-nums data-nums)))

    ;; Normal Elisp:
    (save-match-data
      (let ((pattern "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)")
            (line-nums)
            (data-nums))
        (dolist (line (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2"))
          (when (string-match pattern line)
            (let ((line-num (concat "L" (match-string 1 line)))
                  (datum-num (concat "D" (match-string 2 line))))

              ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

              (push line-num line-nums)
              (push datum-num data-nums))))
        (list (nreverse line-nums) (nreverse data-nums))))
  #+END_SRC

  Here is how one could currently do it with ~loopy~:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'loopy)
    (save-match-data
      (loopy (with (pattern "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)"))
             (list line (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2"))
             (when (string-match pattern line)
               (expr line-num (concat "L" (match-string 1 line)))
               (expr datum-num (concat "D" (match-string 2 line)))

               ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

               (collect line-nums line-num)
               (collect data-nums datum-num))
             (finally-return line-nums data-nums)))
  #+END_SRC

  I believe that the value of the macro increases for longer loop bodies with
  several conditional commands.

  Another nice ability, one that I'm not sure ~cl-loop~ has, is a specific
  command for skipping/continuing a loop iteration.  Of course, one could also
  re-organize code under a conditional command like =when= to achieve the same
  effect.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Returns even numbers that aren't multiples of 10.
    ;;
    ;; => (2 4 6 8 12 14 16 18)
    (loopy (nums i 1 20)
           (when (zerop (mod i 10))
             (skip))
           (when (cl-evenp i)
             (collect i)))
  #+END_SRC

  ~loopy~ and ~cl-loop~ use slightly different terminology.  The equivalent of
  "for clauses" are referred to as "iteration commands" in ~loopy~, as they
  generally are used for iterating through sequences.  Meanwhile, "iteration
  clauses" can be separated into "iteration commands" (=repeat= and =iter-by=
  (not yet implemented)) and "early-exit commands" (=while= and =until=).

  "Accumulation clauses" work the same as "accumulation commands".

** Accumulation Clauses
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: accumulation-clauses
   :END:

   Like with ~cl-loop~, in ~loopy~, accumulation commands accumulate into the
   same variable when no =VAR= is given (by default, ~loopy-result~).  If you
   would like accumulation commands to accumulate into separate variables,
   simple provide =VAR= to the command or use the =split= flag ([[#flags][Using Flags]]).

   | ~cl-loop~                | ~loopy~              |

** Other Clauses

   In ~loopy~, =if=, =when=, and =unless= can take multiple loop commands as
   arguments, and operate more like their Lisp counterparts.

   This means that =if= is not a synonym for =when=.  Just like the normal Lisp
   special form ~if~, =(if COND cmd1 cmd2 cmd3)= only runs =cmd1= if =COND=
   evaluates to non-nil, and only runs commands =cmd2= and =cmd3= if =COND=
   evaluates to ~nil~.

   ~loopy~ also provides the command =cond=, which works like the normal Lisp
   special form ~cond~.

*  Real-World Examples
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Extra example of how one could use `loopy'.
  :END:

  This section contains examples of loops that exist in real-world commands.  To
  see these loops in context, full examples of those commands can be found
  online in the file {{{file(examples/loopy-examples.el)}}} in this package's
  repository [fn:repo].

  One command that could see a benefit from using =loopy= is =selectrum-swiper=
  from the Selectrum wiki [fn:sel-wiki].  This command allows a user to jump to
  a matched line in the buffer.  Candidates are created by looping through text
  lines, formatting non-empty lines and collecting the formatted lines into a
  list of candidates.  At the same time, it selects a default candidate by
  finding the non-empty line closest to the current line.

  Here is the main portion of the command, which uses ~cl-loop~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (cl-loop
     with buffer-lines = (split-string (buffer-string) "\n")
     with number-format = (concat "L%0"
                                  (number-to-string
                                   (length (number-to-string
                                            (length buffer-lines))))
                                  "d: ")

     with formatted-candidates = nil
     for line-text in buffer-lines
     for line-num = (line-number-at-pos (point-min) t) then (1+ line-num)

     with default-candidate = nil
     with prev-distance-to-default-cand = 1.0e+INF ; This updated later.
     for distance-to-default-cand = (abs (- current-line-number line-num))

     unless (string-empty-p line-text)      ; Just skip empty lines.
     do
     ;; Find if we’ve started to move away from the current line.
     (when (null default-candidate)
       (when (> distance-to-default-cand
                prev-distance-to-default-cand)
         (setq default-candidate (cl-first formatted-candidates)))
       (setq prev-distance-to-default-cand distance-to-default-cand))

     ;; Format current line and collect candidate.
     (push (propertize line-text
                       'selectrum-candidate-display-prefix
                       (propertize (format number-format line-num)
                                   'face 'completions-annotations)
                       'line-num line-num)
           formatted-candidates)

     finally return (list default-candidate
                          (nreverse formatted-candidates)))
    ;; ...
  #+end_src

  The limitations of ~cl-loop~'s =when= clause encourages relying on Lisp
  expressions rather than clauses for processing.  To use those Lisp
  expressions, one must declare more variables with the =with= clause to ensure
  that those variables are locally scoped.

  Here is how it could be done with =loopy=:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (loopy
     (with (buffer-text-lines (split-string (buffer-string) "\n"))
           (number-format (concat "L%0"
                                  (number-to-string
                                   (length (number-to-string
                                            (length buffer-text-lines))))
                                  "d: ")))
     (list line-text buffer-text-lines)
     (expr line-num (line-number-at-pos (point-min) t)
           (1+ line-num))
     (unless (string-empty-p line-text)
       (push-into formatted-candidates
                  (propertize line-text
                              'selectrum-candidate-display-prefix
                              (propertize (format number-format line-num)
                                          'face 'completions-annotations)
                              'line-num line-num))
       ;; There are a few different ways that you could express
       ;; this.
       (when (null default-candidate)
         (expr prev-dist +1.0e+INF dist-to-default-cand)
         (expr dist-to-default-cand (abs (- current-line-number
                                            line-num)))
         (when (> dist-to-default-cand prev-dist)
           (expr default-candidate (cl-second formatted-candidates)))))
     (finally-return default-candidate (nreverse formatted-candidates)))
    ;; ...
  #+end_src

  We can see that most of the loop commands are easily grouped under the
  =unless= command.  This allows for less noise, as we do not need to declare
  variables or fall back to using more Lisp expressions.

  Another good example is the command =selectrum-outline= from the same page.
  This command is similar to =selectrum-swiper=, but has a slightly more
  complicated processing portion.

  The code loops through each line in the buffer, searching for lines that match
  a pre-determined regular expression.  The match data is used to determine the
  heading level (top level, second level, etc.) and the actual heading text.
  The loop produces formatted candidates by prepending this heading text with
  the text of parent headings, as determined by the heading level.  At the same
  time, the loop selects the current heading as the default candidate.

  Instead of using ~cl-loop~, this command is written in conventional Emacs
  Lisp.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (let (;; Get the basic information of each heading in the accessible
          ;; portion of the buffer.
          (buffer-lines (split-string (buffer-string) "\n"))
          (line-number 0)
          (line-number-format)

          ;; Finding the default heading
          (default-heading)
          (current-line-number (line-number-at-pos (point)))

          ;; Keeping track of the tree.
          (backwards-prefix-list)
          (prev-heading-text)
          (prev-heading-level)

          ;; Backwards result of the ‘dolist'. Will ‘nreverse’.
          (formatted-headings))

      (setq line-number-format
            (concat "L%0"
                    (number-to-string
                     (length (number-to-string (length buffer-lines))))
                    "d: "))

      (save-match-data
        (dolist (text-line buffer-lines)
          ;; Increment line number when moving to next.
          (cl-incf line-number)
          (when (string-match heading-regexp text-line)

                   (length (match-string-no-properties 1 text-line))))

              ;; Make sure this has a valid value when we first compare.  The
              ;; first comparison should be equal, so that nothing is

  #+end_src

  In my opinion, the =loopy= version is a bit cleaner.  Even when following the
  same flow of logic, you still get the benefit of less typing with no loss in
  clarity.

  If one were writing code like this often (say, in a library), then the loop
  body could be simplified even further with custom commands
  ([[#adding-custom-commands]]).
