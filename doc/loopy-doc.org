=loopy= is a macro meant for iterating and looping.  It is similar in usage to
[[info:cl#Loop Facility][~cl-loop~]] but uses symbolic expressions rather than keywords.

=loopy= should be complementary to the features provided by the [[info:elisp#Sequence Functions][Seq]] and [[info:cl#Top][CL]]
libraries (including =cl-loop=) and Emacs's regular looping and mapping
features.

* Introduction

  The ~loopy~ macro is used to generate code for a loop, similar to ~cl-loop~.
  Unlike ~cl-loop~, ~loopy~ uses symbolic expressions instead of "clauses".

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; A simple usage of `cl-loop':
    (cl-loop for i from 1 to 10
             if (cl-evenp i) collect i into evens
             else collect i into odds
             end ; This `end' keyword is optional here.
             finally return (list odds evens))

    ;; How it could be done using `loopy':
    (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 10))
           (if (cl-evenp i)
               (collect evens i)
             (collect odds i))
           (finally-return odds evens))
  #+end_src

  ~loopy~ supports destructuring for iteration commands like =list= and
  accumulation commands like ~collect~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Summing the nth elements of arrays:
    ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
    (loopy (list (list-elem1 list-elem2)
                 '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
                   ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
           (sum [sum1 sum2 sum3] list-elem1)
           (sum [sum4 sum5 sum6] list-elem2))

    ;; Or, more simply:
    ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
    (loopy (list list-elem '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
                             ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
           (sum ([sum1 sum2 sum3] [sum4 sum5 sum6])
                list-elem))
  #+end_src

  The ~loopy~ macro is configurable and extensible.  In addition to writing one's
  own "loop commands" (such as =list= in the example below), by using "flags",
  one can choose whether to instead use ~pcase-let~, ~seq-let~, or even the Dash
  library for destructuring.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Use Seq.el to destructure an array:
    ;; => ((1 4) ([2 3] [5 6]))
    (loopy (flag seq)
           (list elem '([1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
           (collect [i &rest j] elem))
  #+end_src

  Variables like =elem=, =i=, and =j= in the example above are automatically
  ~let~-bound so as to not affect code outside of the loop.

  ~loopy~ has arguments for binding (or not binding) variables, executing code
  before/after the loop, executing code only if the loop completes, and for
  setting the macro's return value (default ~nil~).  This is in addition to the
  looping features themselves.

  All of this makes ~loopy~ a useful and convenient choice for looping and
  iteration.

  That being said, Loopy is not yet feature complete.  Please request features
  or report problems in this project’s [[https://github.com/okamsn/loopy/issues][issues tracker]].  While most cases are
  covered, full feature parity with some of the more niche uses of =cl-loop= is
  still being worked on.

* Basic Concepts
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-use
  :END:

  Except for an optional loop name, all arguments of the ~loopy~ macro are
  symbolic expressions that create a loop, assigns variables in the lexical
  environment that surrounds the loop, adds code that runs before/after the
  loop, and sets the ultimate return value of the macro.

  For convenience and clarity, symbolic expressions that generate code in the
  loop body are called "loop commands" ([[#loop-commands][Loop Commands]]).  Symbolic
  expressions that generate code around the loop are called "special macro
  arguments" or just "macro arguments" as opposed to "loop commands"
  ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]).

  "Loop commands" are the main feature of the ~loopy~ macro, such as the =list=
  in =(list i '(1 2 3))=.  A command inserts code into the loop body, but can
  also perform additional setup like initializing variables.  Many commands set
  a condition for ending the loop.

  The loop ends when any condition required by a loop command evaluates to
  false.  If no conditions are needed, the loop runs infinitely until a =return=
  or =return-from= command is reached ([[#exiting-the-loop-early][Exiting the Loop Early]]).

  Except when using accumulating loop commands ([[#accumulation-commands][Accumulation Commands]]), return
  values must be stated explicitly, either as an early return in the loop body
  via the =return= or =return-from= commands, or as part of the =finally-return=
  macro argument.  =nil= is returned by default.

* Special Macro Arguments
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: macro-arguments
  :END:

  There are 7 special macro arguments. One, an unquoted symbol, is taken as the
  loop's name. The others, listed below, are symbolic expressions that begin
  with a keyword or one of their aliases. You do not need to use all of them.

  If a macro argument does not match one of these special 7, ~loopy~ will
  attempt to interpret it as a loop command, and throw an error if that fails.

  #+findex: with, let*
  - =with=, =let*= :: Declare variables before the loop.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (loopy (with (a 1) (b 2)) ...)
      (loopy (let* (a 1) (b 2)) ...)
    #+end_src

  #+findex: without, no-init
  - =without=, =no-init= :: Variables that ~loopy~ should not try to
    initialize.  ~loopy~ tries to initialize all the variables it uses in a
    ~let~-like form, but that isn’t always desired.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (let ((a 5))
        ;; Without `without', `loopy' would try to initialize `a' to nil, which would
        ;; overwrite the value of 5 above.
        (loopy (without a)
               (while (not (zerop a)))
               (expr a (1- a)))

        (loopy (no-init a)
               (while (not (zerop a)))
               (expr a (1- a))))
    #+end_src

  #+findex: before-do, before
  - =before-do=, =before= :: Run Lisp expressions before the loop starts.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (loopy (before-do (message "1: before loop")
                        (message "2: before loop"))
             ...)

      (loopy (before (message "1: before loop")
                     (message "2: before loop"))
             ...)
    #+end_src

  #+findex: after-do, after, else-do, else
  - =after-do=, =after=, =else-do=, =else= :: Run Lisp expressions after the
    loop successfully completes.  This is similar to Python’s ~else~ loop
    clause.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (loopy (list i '(2 4 6 8))
             (when (cl-oddp i)
               (do (message "Odd number found."))
               (leave))
             (after-do (message "No odd number found.")))

      (loopy (list i '(2 4 6 8))
             (when (cl-oddp i)
               (do (message "Odd number found."))
               (leave))
             (after (message "No odd number found.")))

      (loopy (list i '(2 4 6 8))
             (when (cl-oddp i)
               (do (message "Odd number found."))
               (leave))
             (else-do (message "No odd number found.")))

      (loopy (list i '(2 4 6 8))
             (when (cl-oddp i)
               (do (message "Odd number found."))
               (leave))
             (else (message "No odd number found.")))
    #+end_src

  #+findex: finally-do, finally
  - =finally-do=, =finally= :: Always run Lisp expressions after the loop
    exits.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
             (when (cl-oddp i) (break))
             (after-do (message "This not messaged."))
             (finally-do (message "This always messaged.")))

      (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
             (when (cl-oddp i) (break))
             (after-do (message "This not messaged."))
             (finally (message "This always messaged.")))
    #+end_src

  #+findex: finally-return
  - =finally-return= :: Return a value, regardless of how the loop
    completes.  Accumulation commands have an implicit return value, but this
    overrides them.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
             (when (cl-oddp i)
               (return "This return value is over-ridden."))
             (finally-return "This string always returned."))
    #+end_src

  #+findex: flag, flags
  - =flag=, =flags= :: Options that change the behavior of ~loopy~.  See the
    section [[*Destructuring with =dash=][Destructuring with =dash=]] for an example.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (loopy (flag dash)
             (list (whole &as a b) '((1 2) (3 4)))
             ...)

      (loopy (flags dash)
             (list (whole &as a b) '((1 2) (3 4)))
             ...)
    #+end_src

  The loop body and any expressions that are part of the =before-do= and
  =after-do= arguments are contained in a single =cl-block=.  Naming the loop
  really just names the block, allowing for more specific exiting via
  ~cl-return~ and the loop commands that wrap it.

  Finally, =(finally-return 1 2 3)= is the same as =(finally-return (list 1 2
  3))=.  This is convenient when using ~seq-let~, ~pcase-let~,
  ~cl-destructuring-bind~, and the like.

* Loop Commands
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: loop-commands
  :END:

  If a macro argument does not match one of the special 7 arguments described
  in [[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]], ~loopy~ will attempt to treat it as a loop command.
  Loop commands are only valid as a top-level argument to the macro, or inside
  another loop command.

  Therefore, these macro calls are valid:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
           (collect coll i)
           ;; Special macro argument:
           (finally-return coll))

    ;; Implicit accumulation variable and implicit return value:
    (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
           (collect i))
  #+END_SRC

  and this is not:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (loopy (with (list i '(1 2 3)))
           (finally-return (collect coll i)))
  #+END_SRC

  Trying to use loop commands where they don't belong will result in errors
  when the code is evaluated.

  Underneath, interpreting a command results in "instructions" that describe
  how to substitute code into the loop body and other locations.  This process
  is described in detail in [[#background-information][Background Information]].

  Some examples of instructions are:
  - Declaring a given variable in a let form to make sure it's locally
    scoped.
  - Declaring a generated variable in a let form to contain a given value.
  - Adding a condition for continuing/exiting the loop.
  - Adding code to be run during the main loop body.
  - Adding code to be run after the main loop body.

 Unless you are writing custom commands, you should not need to know about a
 command’s underlying instructions.  However, you should keep in mind that
 commands and their resulting instructions are evaluated in order.  This means
 that attempting to do something like

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; => (nil 1 2)
    (loopy (collect coll i)
           (list i '(1 2 3))
           (finally-return coll))
  #+END_SRC

  might not do what you expect, as =i= is assigned a value from the list after
  collecting =i= into =coll=.

  For convenience and understanding, the same command might have multiple names
  (such as =expr= having the alias =set=), and some commands can take optional
  arguments (such as =list=).

  For simplicity, the commands are described using the following notation:

  - If a command has multiple names, the names are separated by a vertical
    bar, such as in =expr|set=.
  - =VAR= is an unquoted symbol that will be used as a variable name, such as
    =i= in =(list i my-list)=.
  - =FUNC= is a Lisp function name, such as =my-func=, =#'my-func= or
    ='my-func=.
  - =NAME= is an unquoted name of a loop (or, more accurately, of a
    =cl-block=).
  - =EXPR= is a single Lisp expression, such as =(+ 1 2)=, ='(1 2 3)=,
    =my-var=, or =(some-function my-var)=.  =EXPRS= means multiple expressions.
    Really, we are concerned with the value of the expression, not the
    expression itself.
  - =CMD= is a loop command, as opposed to a normal Lisp expression.
    =(list i '(1 2 3))=, =(repeat 5)=, and =(return-from outer-loop 7)=
    are examples of loop commands.  =CMDS= means multiple commands.
  - Optional arguments are surround by brackets.  =[EXPR]= is an optional
    expression, and =[CMD]= is an optional command.  By extension,
    =[EXPRS]= is equivalent to =[EXPR [EXPR [...]]]=, and =[CMDS]= to
    =[CMD [CMD [...]]]=.

  Generally, =VAR= is initialized to ~nil~, but not always.  This document
  tries to note when that is not the case.

  #+cindex: variable destructuring
  For convenience, =VAR= can be a sequence, either a list or a vector (as a
  stand-in for an array), of symbols instead of a single symbol.  This tells
  the command to “de-structure” the value of =EXPR=, similar to the functions
  ~seq-let~, ~cl-destructuring-bind~, and ~pcase-let~.  This sequence of
  symbols can be shorter than the destructured sequence, /but not longer/.  If
  shorter, the unassigned elements of the list are simply ignored.  To assign
  the final ~cdr~ of a destructured list, use dotted notation.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => [(9 10 11 4) (9 10 11 8)]
    (loopy (with (my-array [(1 2 3 4) (5 6 7 8)]))
           (array-ref (i j k) my-array)
           ;; NOTE: The remaining elements are ignored.
           (do (setf i 9)
               (setf j 10)
               (setf k 11))
           (finally-return my-array))

    ;; => ([9 10 11 4] [9 10 11 8])
    (loopy (with (my-list '([1 2 3 4 ] [5 6 7 8])))
           (list-ref [i j k] my-list)
           ;; NOTE: The remaining elements are ignored.
           (do (setf i 9)
               (setf j 10)
               (setf k 11))
           (finally-return my-list))

    ;; => (1 (2 3))
    (loopy (list (i . j) '((1 2 3)))
           (finally-return i j))

    ;; => ((1 22))
    (loopy (with (my-list '((1 2 3))))
           (list-ref (_ . j) my-list)
           (do (setf j '(22)))
           (finally-return my-list))

    ;; => [(1 22)]
    (loopy (with (my-array [(1 2 3)]))
           (array-ref (_ . j) my-array)
           (do (setf j '(22)))
           (finally-return my-array))
  #+end_src

  Most commands that assign variables (even the =-ref= commands, which use
  ~setf~-able places instead of actual variables) can use destructuring, but
  not all kinds of destructuring make sense in all situations.

** Commands for Generic Evaluation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: commands-for-generic-evaluation
   :END:

   #+findex: do
   - =(do EXPRS)= :: Evaluate multiple Lisp expressions, like a =progn=.

     You cannot include arbitrary code in the loop body.  Trying to do so will
     result in errors, as the macro will attempt to interpret such code as a
     command.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
              (do (message "%d" i)))
     #+END_SRC

   #+findex: expr, exprs, set
   - =(expr|exprs|set VAR [EXPRS])= :: Bind =VAR= to each =EXPR= in order.
     Once the last =EXPR= is reached, it is used repeatedly for the rest of the
     loop.  With no =EXPR=, =VAR= is repeatedly bound to =nil=.

     *NOTE*: Loops are locally scoped, so using this command does not always
     have the same effect as using =(do (setq VAR EXPR))=, as =VAR= is
     initialized to =nil= before the loop starts.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (loopy (repeat 5)
              (expr i 1 2 3)
              (collect coll i)
              (finally-return coll)) ; => '(1 2 3 3 3)

       (loopy (repeat 5)
              (expr i 0 (1+ i))
              (collect coll i)
              (finally-return coll)) ; => '(0 1 2 3 4)
     #+END_SRC

   #+findex: group
   - =(group [CMDS])= :: Evaluate multiple loop commands, as if in a =progn=.
     This is similar to =do=, but runs commands instead of normal Lisp
     expressions.  Currently, this command is only useful when used with the
     =if= command.

** Iteration and Looping Commands
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: iteration-and-looping-commands
   :END:

   Iteration commands bind local variables and determine when the loop ends.
   If no command sets that condition, then the loop runs forever.

   The =-ref= (as in “reference”) commands create ~setf~-able places instead of
   true variables.  Like other commands, they can also use destructuring.  In
   such cases, the variables in the sequence =VAR= are also ~setf~-able places
   instead of true variables.

   #+findex: array
   - =(array VAR EXPR)= :: Loop through the elements of the array =EXPR=.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (loopy (array i [1 2 3])
              (do (message "%d" i)))
     #+END_SRC

   #+findex: array-ref, arrayf
   - =(array-ref|arrayf VAR EXPR)= :: Loop through the elements of the array
     =EXPR=, binding =VAR= as a ~setf~-able place.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (loopy (with (my-str "cat"))
              (array-ref i my-str)
              (do (setf i ?a))
              (finally-return my-str)) ; => "aaa"
     #+END_SRC

   #+findex: cons, conses
   - =(cons|conses VAR EXPR [FUNC])= :: Loop through the cons cells of =EXPR=.
     Optionally, find the cons cells via =FUNC= instead of =cdr=.

     To avoid unneeded variables, when not destructuring, =VAR= is initialized
     to =EXPR= instead of ~nil~.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (loopy (cons i '(1 2 3))
              (collect coll i)
              (finally-return coll)) ; => ((1 2 3) (2 3) (3))
     #+END_SRC

   #+findex: list
   - =(list VAR EXPR [FUNC])= :: Loop through the elements of the list =EXPR=.
     Optionally, update the list by =FUNC= instead of =cdr=.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 10 3)) ; Inclusive, so '(1 4 7 10).
              (do (message "%d" i)))
     #+END_SRC

   #+findex: list-ref, listf
   - =(list-ref|listf VAR EXPR [FUNC])= :: Loop through the elements of the
     list =EXPR=, binding =VAR= as a ~setf~-able place.  Optionally, update the
     list by =FUNC= instead of =cdr=.

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (loopy (with (my-list '(1 2 3)))
              (list-ref i my-list)
              (do (setf i 7))
              (finally-return my-list)) ; Returns '(7 7 7).
     #+END_SRC

   #+findex: repeat

** Accumulation Commands
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: accumulation-commands
   :END:

   Accumulation commands are used to repeatedly update a variable using a
   value.  In that way, they are something like shortcuts for several different
   ways of using the =expr= command.  For example, =(sum my-sum my-var)= is
   really just another way of saying =(expr my-sum 0 (+ my-sum my-var))=.

   If needed, you can refer to the same variable in multiple accumulation
   commands, such as in the following.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect coll i)
            (collect coll (+ i 5))
            (finally-return coll)) ; => (1 6 2 7 3 8)
   #+end_src

   #+cindex: accumulation destructuring
   Using a “destructuring” =VAR= argument in accumulation commands works a bit
   differently than how it would in iteration commands.  While iteration
   commands just assign variables the values that make up the destructured
   =EXPR=, accumulation commands accumulate each of those values into their
   respective variable in the sequence =VAR=.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (collect (coll1 coll2 coll3) elem)
            (finally-return coll1 coll2 coll3))

     ;; => (5 7 9)
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (sum (sum1 sum2 sum3) elem)
            (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3))

     ;; Returns the same values as above.
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (expr sum1 (cl-first elem)  (+ sum1 (cl-first elem)))
            (expr sum2 (cl-second elem) (+ sum2 (cl-second elem)))
            (expr sum3 (cl-third elem)  (+ sum3 (cl-third elem)))
            (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3))
   #+end_src

   #+cindex: implied/implicit return values
   Using an accumulation command implies a return value.  If there are multiple
   accumulations, or destructured accumulations, than the implied return value
   of the loop is a list of those accumulated values in the order that their
   respective command occurs in the loop body.  This implied return value can
   be overridden by using the =return= and =return-from= loop commands or a
   =finally-return= macro argument.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Note that `my-collection' is the first value in the implied return,
     ;; even though the collection happens after the first summation step.
     ;;
     ;; => (((4 5 6)) 5 7 9), for `my-collection', `sum1', `sum2', `sum3'
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (when (equal elem '(4 5 6))
              (collect my-collection elem))
            (sum (my-sum1 my-sum2 my-sum3) elem))
   #+end_src

   #+cindex: implied/implicit accumulation variables
   #+vindex: loopy-result
   Like ~cl-loop~, you do not need to supply a variable name to accumulation
   commands.  With only one argument, they accumulate values into a variable
   named after the loop.  The default name of the variable is =loopy-result=,
   but if you were to name the loop =my-cool-loop=, it would be
   =loopy-my-cool-loop-results=.  This variable is accessible in the loop
   itself and the ~after-do~, ~finally-do~, and ~finally-return~ macro
   arguments.  Note that while its value can be changed in ~after-do~,
   ~finally-do~ alone is too late to effect what the macro returns without also
   using ~finally-return~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 2 3)
     (cl-assert (equal (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (after-do (cl-return loopy-result)))

                       (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (finally-return loopy-result))))

     ;; => (0 1 2 3)
     (cl-assert (equal (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (else-do (push 0 loopy-result)
                                       (cl-return loopy-result)))
                       (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
                              (collect i)
                              (finally-do (push 0 loopy-result))
                              (finally-return loopy-result))))
   #+end_src

   Like in ~cl-loop~, each accumulation command will use the same implied
   variable.  This means that several uses of =(collect my-value)=, for
   example, will all collect values into the same variable.  If you want to use
   to collect into separate variables, just specify a variable name like you
   normally would.

   The commands =collect=, =append=, and =nconc= are more efficient if no =VAR=
   is provided, constructing the accumulated value backwards and then reversing
   it, which is usually faster.  This means that if you want to use
   destructuring with accumulation commands, it might be faster to use the
   [[*Splitting Accumulation Results with Implicit Variables][=split= flag]], which will make ~loopy~ accumulate into separate implied variables
   instead of the same ~loopy-result~.  See that section for more details.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Both of these example give the same result, but the latter can
     ;; expand into more efficient code.
     ;; There is also the `push-into' commands, which avoids this problem.

     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))

   #+findex: sub-loop, subloop, loop
   - =(sub-loop|subloop|loop [CMDS])= :: Create a sub-loop in the same lexical
     environment as the top-level loop.


   There are two main ways to have a sub-loop in ~loopy~:

   1. Use another ~loopy~ call in a =do= command.
   2. Use the =sub-loop= (aliases =loop= and =subloop=) command.

   =sub-loop= is better for accumulating into variables, as is does not create
   its own result variable (unlike calling ~loopy~ again).  When using the
   =sub-loop= command, keep in mind the following:

   1. Only loop commands are valid within a sub-loop, not special macro
      arguments like =with= or =finally-return=.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; GOOD:
        ;; => (8 9 10)
        (loopy (with (a 7))
               (repeat 1)
               (loop (list i '(1 2 3))
                     (collect (+ a i))))

        ;; BAD:
        (loopy (repeat 1)
               (loop (with (a 7))
                     (list i '(1 2 3))
                     (collect (+ a i))))
      #+end_src

   2. Sub-loops can be named, but they do not have their own return value. The
      default loop name in ~loopy~ is ~nil~ for the top-level loop, but not for
      sub-loops.  To return from the outer loop, you can use =return-from=.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; Return from inner1 so never reach 4.
        ;; => ((3 5) (3 5))
        (loopy (repeat 2)
               (loop inner1
                     (list j '(3 4))
                     (loop (list k '(5 6 7))
                           (if (= k 6)
                               (return-from inner1)
                             (collect (list j k))))))

        ;; Can use `return-from' on `nil' to refer to the
        ;; top-level loop, if un-named. Otherwise use the name.
        (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
               (loop (list j '(5 4 3))
                     (if (= i j)
                         (return-from nil i)
                       (collect (cons i j)))))
      #+end_src

      Because there is no return value for sub-loops, the =return= and =leave=
      commands behave similarly.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => ((1 .6) (2 . 6))
        (loopy (list i '(1 2))
               (loop (list j '(6 7 8))
                     (if (= j 7)
                         (return)
                       (collect (cons i j)))))

        ;; => ((1 .6) (2 . 6))
        (loopy (list i '(1 2))
               (loop (list j '(6 7 8))
                     (if (= j 7)
                         (leave)
                       (collect (cons i j)))))
      #+end_src

   3. Variables used for iteration can be local to a sub-loop, but not
      variables used for accumulation.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; GOOD:
        ;; => (0 1 2 3 1 2 3)
        (loopy (repeat 2)
               (loop (list i '(1 2 3))
                     (collect my-coll i))
               (finally-return (cons 0 my-coll)))

        ;; BAD:
        ;; Would not give (0 3 3).  Instead, signals error.
        (loopy (repeat 2)
               (loop (list i '(1 2 3)))
               ;; Error:  `i' doesn't exist outside the sub-loop:
               (collect my-coll i)
               (finally-return (cons 0 my-coll)))
      #+end_src


* Changing the Macro's Behavior with Flags

  #+cindex: flag
  A "flag" is a symbol passed to the =flag= or =flags= macro argument, and
  changes the macro's behavior.  Currently, flags affect what ~loopy~ uses to
  perform destructuring (~pcase-let~, ~seq-let~, =dash=, or the default method)
  and whether accumulation commands that don't specify a variable (such as
  =(collect collect-value)=) accumulate into one or several variables.

  Flags are applied in order, so if you specify =(flags seq pcase)= ~loopy~ will
  use ~pcase-let~ for destructuring, not ~seq-let~.

  #+vindex: loopy-default-flags
  If you wish to always use a flag, you can add that flag to the list
  ~loopy-default-flags~.  These can be overridden by any flag given in the
  =flag= macro argument.

  The following flags are currently supported:

  #+cindex: pcase flag
  - =pcase= :: Use ~pcase-let~ for destructuring.  See the [[info:elisp#Destructuring with pcase Patterns][~pcase~ documentation]].
  #+cindex: seq flag
  - =seq= :: Use ~seq-let~ for destructuring.  See the documentation for [[info:elisp#Sequence Functions][~seq-let~]].
  #+cindex: dash flag
  - =dash= :: Use the style of destructuring found in the =dash= library, as if
    via [[info:dash#-let][~-let~]].
  #+cindex: split flag
  - =split= :: Make accumulation commands with implicit variables accumulate into
    separate variables instead of into ~loopy-result~.
  #+cindex: default flag
  - =default= :: Use the default behavior for all options.


  For convenience, all flags (except =default=) can be undone by prefixing them
  with =-= (a dash or minus sign), which reverts ~loopy~ to its default
  behavior.

  For example, if you have set ~loopy-default-flags~ to =(dash split)= and wish
  to only use the =split= flag for a loop, you can use either =(flags default
  split)= or, more simply, =(flag -dash)=.  These prefixed flags only apply when
  the unprefixed version is active.  That is, =(flags pcase -dash)= is the same
  as just =(flags pcase)=, regardless of the value of ~loopy-default-flags~, as
  =pcase= destructuring will override all uses of =dash= destructuring as it
  comes later in the list.  Similarly, =(flags -dash dash)= and =(flags -dash
  +dash)= leave =dash= destructuring enabled, and =(flags +dash -dash)= disables
  =dash= destructuring and uses the default behavior.

  #+cindex: loopy-dash
  #+cindex: loopy-pcase
  #+cindex: loopy-seq
  The destructuring flags (=pcase=, =seq=, and =dash=) are separate libraries
  (respectively, =loopy-pcase=, =loopy-seq=, and =loopy-dash=) that must be
  loaded after =loopy=.  Currently, =loopy-dash= is a separate package.

  Below are some example of using the destructuring flags.  These flags do not
  affect the destructuring of commands using generalized variables (i.e.,
  ~setf~-able places).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6))) ; whole
    ;;     (1 4)                 ; i
    ;;     (2 5)                 ; j
    ;;     (3 6))                ; k
    (require 'loopy-dash)
    (loopy (flag dash)
           (list elem '((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6))))
           (collect (whole &as i (j k)) elem))

    ;; => ((1 4) (3 6))
    (require 'loopy-pcase)
    (loopy (flag pcase)
           (list elem '((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6))))
           (collect `(,a (,_ ,b)) elem))

    ;; => ((1 6) (3 8) ([4 5] [9 10]))
    (require 'loopy-seq)
    (loopy (flag seq)
           (list elem '([1 2 3 4 5] [6 7 8 9 10]))
           (collect [a _ b &rest c] elem))
  #+end_src

  The =split= flag can be more efficient than using destructuring with
  accumulation commands.  Some accumulation commands can have more efficient
  behavior when using implicit accumulation variables, since the variables can't
  be accessed until the loop ends.  Using the =split= flag allows you to do this
  easily for multiple variables.

  This can make a noticeable difference on large lists, but note that if you use
  this feature, you will not be able to access the implicit return values with
  loopy-result.  They will each have their own, uniquely generated name in
  each loop.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Both of these example give the same result, but the latter
     ;; can expand into more efficient code.
     ;;
     ;; There is also the `push-into' command, which avoids this problem when
     ;; used with `nreverse'.

     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (collect (i j k) elem))

     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
     (loopy (flag split) ; Don't accumulate into same implicit variable.
            (list (i j k) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (collect i)
            (collect j)
            (collect k))
   #+end_src

   Below is an example of the split flag.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 2 3 4 5)
     (loopy (flag -split)
            (list i '(1 2 3 4 5))
            (if (cl-oddp i)
                (collect i)
              (collect i))
            ;; For un-named loops, the variable is `loopy-result'.
            (finally-return loopy-result))

     ;; => ((1 3 5) (2 4))
     (loopy (flag split)
            (list i '(1 2 3 4 5))
            (if (cl-oddp i)
                (collect i)
              (collect i)))
   #+end_src


* Adding Custom Commands
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: adding-custom-commands
  :END:

** Background Information
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background-information
   :END:

   The core working of =loopy= is taking a command and generating code that is
   substituted into or around a loop body.

   For example, parsing the command =(list i '(1 2 3))= produces the following
   list of instructions.  Some commands require the creation of unique temporary
   variables, such as =list-3717= in the below output.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ((loopy--iteration-vars list-3717 '(1 2 3))
      (loopy--latter-body setq list-3717 (cdr list-3717))
      (loopy--pre-conditions consp list-3717)
      (loopy--main-body setq i (car list-3717))
      (loopy--iteration-vars i nil))
   #+END_SRC

   The ~car~ of an instruction is the place to put code and the ~cdr~ of the
   instruction is said code to put.  You can see that not all of the code to be
   inserted is a valid Lisp form.  Instead of being evaluated as an expression,
   some instructions insert pairs of names and values into variable lists like
   in ~let~ and ~let*~ .

   | Place                   | Code                               |
   |-------------------------+------------------------------------|
   | =loopy--iteration-vars= | =(list-3717 '(1 2 3))=             |
   | =loopy--latter-body=    | =(setq list-3717 (cdr list-3717))= |
   | =loopy--pre-conditions= | =(consp list-3717)=                |
   | =loopy--main-body=      | =(setq i (car list-3717))=         |
   | =loopy--iteration-vars= | =(i nil)=                          |

   Commands are parsed by =loopy--parse-loop-commands=, which receives a list of
   commands and returns a list of instructions.  For commands that take
   sub-commands as arguments (such as =cond=, =if=, and =when=), more specific
   parsing functions are called in a mutually recursive fashion (e.g.,
   Function-1 uses Function-2 which uses Function-1, and so on).

   For example, consider the function =loopy--parse-if-command=, which parses
   the =if= command.  It needs to be able to group any code going to the loop
   body under an ~if~-form.  To do this, it uses =loopy--parse-loop-command= to
   turn its sub-commands into a list of instructions, and then checks the =car=
   of each instruction to whether the code should be inserted into the loop's
   main body (and so whether it should be wrapped in the ~if~-form).

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (cl-defun loopy--parse-if-command
         ((_ condition &optional if-true &rest if-false))
       "Parse the `if' loop command.  This takes the entire command.

     - CONDITION is a Lisp expression.
     - IF-TRUE is the first sub-command of the `if' command.
     - IF-FALSE are all the other sub-commands."
       (let (full-instructions
             if-true-main-body
             if-false-main-body)
         (dolist (instruction (loopy--parse-loop-command if-true))
           (if (eq 'loopy--main-body (car instruction))
               (push (cdr instruction) if-true-main-body)
             (push instruction full-instructions)))
         (dolist (instruction (loopy--parse-loop-commands if-false))
           (if (eq 'loopy--main-body (car instruction))
               (push (cdr instruction) if-false-main-body)
             (push instruction full-instructions)))
         ;; Push the actual main-body instruction.
         (setq if-true-main-body
               (if (= 1 (length if-true-main-body))
                   (car if-true-main-body)
                 (cons 'progn (nreverse if-true-main-body))))

         ;; Return the list of instructions.
         (cons `(loopy--main-body
                 . (if ,condition
                       ,if-true-main-body
                     ,@(nreverse if-false-main-body)))
               (nreverse full-instructions))))
   #+END_SRC

   The hardest part of this exchange is making sure the inserted code ends up in
   the correct order.

   A loop body command has 7 main places to put code:

   #+vindex: loopy--generalized-vars
   - =loopy--generalized-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and a macro
     expansion that will be given to =cl-symbol-macrolet=.  This is used to
     create named ~setf~-able places.  The expansion you use depends on the kind
     of sequence and how the it is updated.

     For example, =(list-ref i my-list)= declares =i= to be a symbol which
     expands to =(car TEMP-VAR)=, in which =TEMP-VAR= holds the value of
     =my-list=.  At the end of the loop body, =TEMP-VAR= is set to its =cdr=,
     ensuring that the next call to =car= returns the correct value.

   #+vindex: loopy--iteration-vars
   - =loopy--iteration-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and an expression that will be
     given to ~let*~.  This is used for initializing variables needed for
     iteration commands, such as the =i= in =(list i '(1 2 3))= or to store the
     list ='(1 2 3)= in =(list i '(1 2 3))=.  This also includes variables
     needed for destructuring.

   #+vindex: loopy--accumulation-vars
   - =loopy--accumulation-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and an expression that will
     be given to ~let*~.  This is used for initializing variables needed for
     accumulation commands, such as the =coll= in =(collect coll my-val)= or any
     variables needed for destructuring.

   #+vindex: loopy--pre-conditions
   - =loopy--pre-conditions= :: Expressions that determine if the =while=
     loop runs/continues, such as whether a list still has elements in it.
     If there is more than one expression, than all expressions are used in
     an =and= special form.

   #+vindex: loopy--main-body
   - =loopy--main-body= :: Expressions that make up the main body of the
     loop.

   #+vindex: loopy--latter-body
   - =loopy--latter-body= :: Expressions that need to be run after the main
     body, such as updating some of variables that determine when a loop ends.

   #+vindex: loopy--post-conditions
   - =loopy--post-conditions= :: Expressions that determine whether the
     =while= loop continues, but checked after the loop body has run.  The
     code from this is ultimately appended to the latter body before being
     substituted in.

   There are 4 more variables a loop command can push to, but they are derived
   from the macro's arguments.  Adding to them after using a macro argument
   might lead to unintended behavior.  You might wish to use them if, for
   example, you are concerned with what happens after the loop exits/completes.

   #+vindex: loopy--before-do
   - =loopy--before-do= :: Expressions to evaluate before the loop.  These are
     derived from the =before-do= macro argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--after-do
   - =loopy--after-do= :: Expressions to evaluate after the loop completes
     successfully.  These are derived from the =after-do= macro argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--final-do
   - =loopy--final-do= :: Expressions to evaluate after the loop completes,
     regardless of success.  These are derived from the =finally-do= macro
     argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--final-return
   - =loopy--final-return= :: An expression that is always returned by the
     macro, regardless of any early returns in the loop body.  This is
     derived from the =finally-return= macro argument.

   The structure of the macro’s expanded code depends on the features used
   (e.g., =loopy= won’t try to declare variables if none exist), but the result
   will work similar to the below example.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     `(cl-symbol-macrolet ,loopy--generalized-vars
        (let* ,loopy--with-vars
          (let ,loopy--accumulation-vars
            (let* ,loopy--iteration-vars
              (let ((loopy--early-return-capture

                                 (1 (car loopy--pre-conditions))
                                 (t (cons 'and loopy--pre-conditions)))
                         (cl-tagbody

                       ,@loopy--after-do
                       nil)))
                ,@loopy--final-do
                ,(if loopy--final-return
                     loopy--final-return

   #+END_SRC

** A Small Example
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-small-example
   :END:

   To implement a custom loop body command, =loopy= needs two pieces of
   information:
   1. The keyword that names your command
   2. The parsing function that can turn uses of your command into instructions.

   Importantly, your custom commands cannot share a name.

   For example, say that you're tired of typing out
   =(do (message "Hello, %s" first last))= and would prefer to instead use
   =(greet FIRST [LAST])=.  This only requires pushing code into the main
   loopy body, so the definition of the parsing function is quite simple.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (cl-defun my-loopy-greet-command-parser ((_ first &optional last))
       "Greet one with first name FIRST and optional last name LAST."
       `((loopy--main-body . (if ,last
                                 (message "Hello, %s %s" ,first ,last)
                               (message "Hello, %s" ,first)))))
   #+END_SRC

   =loopy= will pass the entire command expression to the parsing function, and
   expects back a list of instructions.

   #+vindex: loopy-custom-command-parsers
   To tell =loopy= about this function, add it and the command name =greet= to
   the variable =loopy-custom-command-parsers=.  When ~loopy~ doesn’t recognize
   a command, it will search in this alist for a matching symbol.  The function
   that is paired with the symbol receives the entire command expressions, and
   should produce a list of valid instructions.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'loopy-custom-command-parsers
                  '(greet . my-loopy-greet-command-parser))
   #+END_SRC

   After that, you can use your custom command in the loop body.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (loopy (list name '(("John" "Deer") ("Jane" "Doe") ("Jimmy")))
            (greet (car name) (cadr name)))
   #+END_SRC

   By running =M-x pp-macroexpand-last-sexp= on the above expression, you can
   see that it expands to do what we want, as expected.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (let ((g815 '(("John" "Deer")
                   ("Jane" "Doe")
                   ("Jimmy")))
           (name nil))
       (while (consp g815)
         (setq name (car g815))
         (if (cadr name)
             (message "Hello, %s %s"
                      (car name) (cadr name))
           (message "Hello, %s" (car name)))
         (setq g815 (cdr g815)))
       nil)
   #+END_SRC

** A Slightly More Complicated Example
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-slightly-more-complicated-example
   :END:

   Lets say we want to emulate =cl-loop='s =always= clause, which causes the
   loop to return =nil= if an expression evaluates to =nil= and =t= otherwise.

   Here is an example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (cl-loop for i in (number-sequence 1 9) always (< i 10)) ; => t
   #+END_SRC

   Without a custom command, you could translate this using the following.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9))
            (unless (< i 10) (return nil))
            (else-do (cl-return t)))
   #+END_SRC

   While its meaning is clear, this approach is certainly wordier.  Here's how
   you could do it with a custom command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (cl-defun my--loopy-always-command-parser ((_ &rest conditions))
       "Parse a command of the form `(always [CONDITIONS])'.
     If any condition is `nil', `loopy' should immediately return nil.
     Otherwise, `loopy' should return t."
       (let (instructions)
         ;; Return t if loop completes successfully.
         (push `(loopy--after-do . (cl-return t)) instructions)
         ;; Check all conditions at the end of the loop body, forcing an exit if any
         ;; evaluate to nil.  Since the default return value of the macro is nil, we
         ;; don’t need to do anything else.
         ;;
         ;; NOTE: We must not add anything to `loopy--final-return', since that
         ;;       would override the value of any early returns.
         (dolist (condition conditions)
           (push `(loopy--post-conditions . ,condition) instructions))
         instructions))

     (add-to-list 'loopy-custom-command-parsers
                  (cons 'always #'my--loopy-always-command-parser))

     ;; One condition: => t
     (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9)) (always (< i 10)))

     ;; Two conditions: => nil
     (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9))
            (list j '(2 4 6 8 9))
            (always (< i 10) (cl-evenp j)))
   #+END_SRC

   This command (and equivalents of the =never= and =thereis= clauses) aren’t

* How does it compare to =cl-loop=?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: how-does-it-compare-to-other-approaches
  :END:

  =loopy= should be comparable with =cl-loop= for most things, keeping in
  mind the following:
  - It is probably less efficient than =cl-loop=, though I am so far trying to
    keep the same logic that =cl-loop= uses.
  - It has more flexible control-flow commands, under which you can easily group
    sub-commands, including assignments.
  - It has a =skip= command to skip the rest of the loop body and immediately
    start the next iteration.  Of course, a similar effect could be achieved
    using the =when= or =unless= commands.

  =loopy= is not always one-to-one replacement for =cl-loop=, but it is easy to
  use and extend, and performs well in the cases that it already handles.

  Below is a simple example of =loopy= vs =cl-loop=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'cl-lib)
    (cl-loop with some-thing = 5
             for i from 1 to 100
             do (message "I is %s" i)
             when (> (+ i 5) 20)
             return (format "Done: %d" i))

    (require 'loopy)
    (loopy (with (some-thing 5))
           (list i (number-sequence 1 100))
           (do (message "I is %s" i))
           (when (> (+ i 5) 20)
             (return (format "Done: %d" i))))
  #+END_SRC

  The main benefit (I believe) of Loopy is clearer grouping of commands under
  conditionals while still using a clean syntax, such as in the below example.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; => '((2 4) (4 8) (6 12) (8 16) (10 20))
    (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 10))
           (when (cl-evenp i)
             (expr once i)
             (expr twice (* 2 i))
             (collect together (list once twice)))
           (finally-return together))
  #+END_SRC

  In my experience, =cl-loop= does not allow the easy grouping of assignment
  statements under a =when= condition.  For example, below is something I would
  like to try to do with =cl-loop=.

  I am aware that in this example the =for= statements aren't necessary and that
  the =collect= statements would be sufficient, but (when I come across things
  like this in my work) I would like to use them to declare variables for
  readability purposes.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'cl-lib)
    (save-match-data
      (cl-loop with pattern = "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)"
               for line in (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2")
               when (string-match pattern line)
               for line-num = (concat "L" (match-string 1 line))
               and for data-num = (concat "D" (match-string 2 line))

               ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

               and collect line-num into line-nums
               and collect data-num into data-nums
               finally return (list line-nums data-nums)))

    ;; Normal Elisp:
    (save-match-data
      (let ((pattern "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)")
            (line-nums)
            (data-nums))
        (dolist (line (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2"))
          (when (string-match pattern line)
            (let ((line-num (concat "L" (match-string 1 line)))
                  (datum-num (concat "D" (match-string 2 line))))

              ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

              (push line-num line-nums)
              (push datum-num data-nums))))
        (list (nreverse line-nums) (nreverse data-nums))))
  #+END_SRC

  Here is how one could currently do it with =loopy=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'loopy)
    (save-match-data
      (loopy (with (pattern "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)"))
             (list line (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2"))
             (when (string-match pattern line)
               (expr line-num (concat "L" (match-string 1 line)))
               (expr datum-num (concat "D" (match-string 2 line)))

               ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

               (collect line-nums line-num)
               (collect data-nums datum-num))
             (finally-return line-nums data-nums)))
  #+END_SRC

  I believe that the value of the macro increases for longer loop bodies with
  several conditional commands.

  Another nice ability, one that I'm not sure =cl-loop= has, is a specific
  command for skipping/continuing a loop iteration.  Of course, one could also
  re-organize code under a conditional command like =when= to achieve the same
  effect.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Returns even numbers that aren't multiples of 10.
    (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 20))
           (when (zerop (mod i 10))
             (skip))
           (when (cl-evenp i)
             (push-into my-collection i))
           (finally-return (nreverse my-collection))) ; => (2 4 6 8 12 14 16 18)

*** For Clauses

    :CUSTOM_ID: for-clauses
    :END:

    As Emacs has many functions that return lists, there is no need to implement
    an exact equivalent for every =for=-clause that =cl-loop= has.  Instead, one
    can just iterate through the return value of the appropriate function using
    the =list= command.

    | =cl-loop=                                     | =loopy=                                          |

*** Iteration Clauses
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: iteration-clauses

    | =while COND=       | =(while COND)= |
    | =until COND=       | =(until COND)= |
    | =iter-by iterator= | None so far.   |

    The clauses =always=, =never=, and =thereis= can be replaced by a
    combination of an exiting command and the =after-do= (also written
    =else-do=) macro argument.  Below is an example from the CL Lib manual.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      ;; With `cl-loop':
      (if (cl-loop for size in size-list always (> size 10))
          (only-big-sizes)
        (some-small-sizes))

      ;; With `loopy':
      ;; Depends on whether the functions have return values.
      (loopy (list size size-list)
             ;; `return` is just a wrapper for `cl-return`.
             (when (< size 10) (return (some-small-sizes)))
             ;; Only runs if loop doesn't exit early.
             (else-do (cl-return (only-big-sizes))))
    #+END_SRC

    A seen in the above example, =loopy= does not always have a one-to-one
    translation to =cl-loop= ([[#a-slightly-more-complicated-example][though you could try a custom command]]).

    It is not an explicit goal to be able to replace all uses of =cl-loop= with
    =loopy=.  I'd prefer that =loopy= be useful in places where =cl-loop= might
    not be enough, instead of forcing =loopy= into places where =cl-loop=
    already works well.

    Other options in the above example include using =cl-every=,
    =seq-every-p=, Dash’s =-all?=, etc.

*** Accumulation Clauses
    :PROPERTIES:

    :END:

    In =loopy=, when accumulation commands are not given a =VAR=, they
    accumulate into different variables.  If you want accumulations to act on
    the same variable, you must give the same =VAR=.

    | =cl-loop=                | =loopy=              |

    :CUSTOM_ID: other-clauses
    :END:

    In =loopy=, =if=, =when=, and =unless= can take multiple loop commands as
    arguments, and operate more like their Lisp counterparts.

    This means that =if= is not a synonym for =when=.  Just like the normal Lisp
    special form =if=, =(if COND cmd1 cmd2 cmd3)= only runs =cmd1= if =COND=
    evaluates to non-nil, and only runs commands =cmd2= and =cmd3= if =COND=
    evaluates to =nil=.

    =loopy= also provides the command =cond=, which works like the normal Lisp
    special form =cond=.

*  Real-World Examples

  This section contains examples of loops that exist in real-world commands.  To
  see these loops in context, full examples of those commands can be found in
  the file [[file:loopy-examples.el]] (containing the library =loopy-examples=) that
  comes with this package.

  One command that could see a benefit from using =loopy= is =selectrum-swiper=
  from the Selectrum wiki [fn:sel-wiki].  This command allows a user to jump to
  a matched line in the buffer.  Candidates are created by looping through text
  lines, formatting non-empty lines and collecting the formatted lines into a
  list of candidates.  At the same time, it selects a default candidate by
  finding the non-empty line closest to the current line.

  Here is the main portion of the command, which uses =cl-loop=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (cl-loop
     with buffer-lines = (split-string (buffer-string) "\n")
     with number-format = (concat "L%0"
                                  (number-to-string
                                   (length (number-to-string
                                            (length buffer-lines))))
                                  "d: ")

     with formatted-candidates = nil
     for line-text in buffer-lines
     for line-num = (line-number-at-pos (point-min) t) then (1+ line-num)

     with default-candidate = nil
     with prev-distance-to-default-cand = 1.0e+INF ; This updated later.
     for distance-to-default-cand = (abs (- current-line-number line-num))

     unless (string-empty-p line-text)      ; Just skip empty lines.
     do
     ;; Find if we’ve started to move away from the current line.
     (when (null default-candidate)
       (when (> distance-to-default-cand
                prev-distance-to-default-cand)
         (setq default-candidate (cl-first formatted-candidates)))
       (setq prev-distance-to-default-cand distance-to-default-cand))

     ;; Format current line and collect candidate.
     (push (propertize line-text
                       'selectrum-candidate-display-prefix
                       (propertize (format number-format line-num)
                                   'face 'completions-annotations)
                       'line-num line-num)
           formatted-candidates)

     finally return (list default-candidate
                          (nreverse formatted-candidates)))
    ;; ...
  #+end_src

  The limitations of =cl-loop='s =when= clause encourages relying on Lisp
  expressions rather than clauses for processing.  To use those Lisp
  expressions, one must declare more variables with the =with= clause to ensure
  that those variables are locally scoped.

  Here is how it could be done with =loopy=:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (loopy
     (with (buffer-text-lines (split-string (buffer-string) "\n"))
           (number-format (concat "L%0"
                                  (number-to-string
                                   (length (number-to-string
                                            (length buffer-text-lines))))
                                  "d: ")))
     (list line-text buffer-text-lines)
     (expr line-num (line-number-at-pos (point-min) t)
           (1+ line-num))
     (unless (string-empty-p line-text)
       (push-into formatted-candidates
                  (propertize line-text
                              'selectrum-candidate-display-prefix
                              (propertize (format number-format line-num)
                                          'face 'completions-annotations)
                              'line-num line-num))
       ;; There are a few different ways that you could express
       ;; this.
       (when (null default-candidate)
         (expr prev-dist +1.0e+INF dist-to-default-cand)
         (expr dist-to-default-cand (abs (- current-line-number
                                            line-num)))
         (when (> dist-to-default-cand prev-dist)
           (expr default-candidate (cl-second formatted-candidates)))))
     (finally-return default-candidate (nreverse formatted-candidates)))
    ;; ...
  #+end_src

  We can see that most of the loop commands are easily grouped under the
  =unless= command.  This allows for less noise, as we do not need to declare
  variables or fall back to using more Lisp expressions.

  Another good example is the command =selectrum-outline= from the same page.
  This command is similar to =selectrum-swiper=, but has a slightly more
  complicated processing portion.

  The code loops through each line in the buffer, searching for lines that match
  a pre-determined regular expression.  The match data is used to determine the
  heading level (top level, second level, etc.) and the actual heading text.
  The loop produces formatted candidates by prepending this heading text with
  the text of parent headings, as determined by the heading level.  At the same
  time, the loop selects the current heading as the default candidate.

  Instead of using =cl-loop=, this command is written in conventional Emacs
  Lisp.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (let (;; Get the basic information of each heading in the accessible
          ;; portion of the buffer.
          (buffer-lines (split-string (buffer-string) "\n"))
          (line-number 0)
          (line-number-format)

          ;; Finding the default heading
          (default-heading)
          (current-line-number (line-number-at-pos (point)))

          ;; Keeping track of the tree.
          (backwards-prefix-list)
          (prev-heading-text)
          (prev-heading-level)

          ;; Backwards result of the ‘dolist'. Will ‘nreverse’.
          (formatted-headings))

      (setq line-number-format
            (concat "L%0"
                    (number-to-string
                     (length (number-to-string (length buffer-lines))))
                    "d: "))

      (save-match-data
        (dolist (text-line buffer-lines)
          ;; Increment line number when moving to next.
          (cl-incf line-number)
          (when (string-match heading-regexp text-line)
            (let ((heading-text (match-string-no-properties 2 text-line))
                  (heading-level
                   (length (match-string-no-properties 1 text-line))))

              ;; Make sure this has a valid value when we first compare.  The

  #+end_src

  In my opinion, the =loopy= version is a bit cleaner.  Even when following the
  same flow of logic, you still get the benefit of less typing with no loss in
  clarity.

  If one were writing code like this often (say, in a library), then the loop
  body could be simplified even further with [[#adding-custom-commands][custom commands]].
