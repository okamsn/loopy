~loopy~ is a macro meant for iterating and looping.  It is similar in usage to
~cl-loop~ ([[info:cl#Loop Facility]]) but uses parenthesized expressions rather than
keyword clauses.

For most cases, ~loopy~ is a featureful replacement for ~cl-loop~ and
complementary to Emacs's built-in looping and mapping features (such as the
libraries =seq= ([[info:elisp#Sequence Functions]]) and =cl-lib= ([[info:cl]])).

* Introduction
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: A short overview.
  :END:

  The ~loopy~ macro is used to generate code for a loop, similar to ~cl-loop~.
  Unlike ~cl-loop~, ~loopy~ uses parenthesized expressions instead of "clauses".

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; A simple usage of `cl-loop':
    (cl-loop for i from 1 to 10
             if (cl-evenp i) collect i into evens
             else collect i into odds
             end ; This `end' keyword is optional here.
             finally return (list odds evens))

    ;; How it could be done using `loopy':
    (loopy (numbers i 1 10)
           (if (cl-evenp i)
               (collect evens i)
             (collect odds i))
           (finally-return odds evens))
  #+end_src

  ~loopy~ supports destructuring for iteration commands like =list= and
  accumulation commands like =sum= or =collect=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Summing the nth elements of arrays:
    ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
    (loopy (list (list-elem1 list-elem2)
                 '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
                   ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
           (sum [sum1 sum2 sum3] list-elem1)
           (sum [sum4 sum5 sum6] list-elem2)
           (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3 sum4 sum5 sum6))

    ;; Or, more simply:
    ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
    (loopy (list list-elem '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
                             ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
           (sum ([sum1 sum2 sum3] [sum4 sum5 sum6])
                list-elem)
           (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3 sum4 sum5 sum6))

    ;; Separate the elements of sub-list:
    ;; => ((1 3) (2 4))
    (loopy (list i '((1 2) (3 4)))
           (collect (elem1 elem2) i)
           (finally-return elem1 elem2))
  #+end_src

  The ~loopy~ macro is configurable and extensible.  In addition to writing
  one's own "loop commands" (such as =list= in the example below), by using
  "flags", one can choose whether to instead use ~pcase-let~, ~seq-let~, or even
  the Dash library for destructuring.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Use `pcase' to destructure array elements:
    ;; => ((1 2 3 4) (10 12 14) (11 13 15))
    (loopy (flag pcase)
           (array (or `(,car . ,cdr) digit)
                  [1 (10 . 11) 2 (12 . 13) 3 4 (14 . 15)])
           (if digit
               (collect digits digit)
             (collect cars car)
             (collect cdrs cdr))
           (finally-return digits cars cdrs))

    ;; Using the default destructuring:
    ;; => ((1 2 3 4) (10 12 14) (11 13 15))
    (loopy (array elem [1 (10 . 11) 2 (12 . 13) 3 4 (14 . 15)])
           (if (numberp elem)
               (collect digits elem)
             (collect (cars . cdrs) elem))
           (finally-return digits cars cdrs))
  #+end_src

  Variables like ~cars~, ~cdrs~, and ~digits~ in the example above are
  automatically ~let~-bound so as to not affect code outside of the loop.

  ~loopy~ has arguments for binding (or not binding) variables, executing code
  before/after the loop, executing code only if the loop completes, and for
  setting the macro's return value (default ~nil~).  This is in addition to the
  looping features themselves.

  All of this makes ~loopy~ a useful and convenient choice for looping and
  iteration.

  That being said, Loopy is not yet feature complete.  Please request features
  or report problems in this project’s [[https://github.com/okamsn/loopy/issues][issues tracker]].  While most cases are
  covered, full feature parity with some of the more niche uses of ~cl-loop~ is
  still being worked on.

* Basic Concepts
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: basic-concepts
  :DESCRIPTION: Basic information about `loopy' and its loops.
  :END:

  Except for an optional loop name, all arguments of the ~loopy~ macro are
  parenthesized expressions.  These expressions can, for example, assign
  variables local to the loop, add code that runs before/after the loop, and/or
  set the ultimate return value of the macro.

  For convenience and clarity, expressions that generate code in the loop body
  are called "loop commands" ([[#loop-commands][Loop Commands]]).  Expressions that generate code
  around the loop are called "special macro arguments" or just "macro arguments"
  as opposed to "loop commands" ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]).

  "Loop commands" are the main feature of the ~loopy~ macro, such as the command
  =list= in the expression =(list i '(1 2 3))=.  A command inserts code into the
  loop body, but can also perform additional setup like initializing variables.
  Many commands set a condition for ending the loop.  In the case of =list=, it
  iterates through the elements of a list, the variable ~i~ to each element.
  After iterating through all elements, the loop is forced to end.

  The loop ends when any condition required by a loop command evaluates to
  ~nil~.  If no conditions are needed, the loop runs infinitely until a =return=
  or =return-from= command is reached ([[#exiting-the-loop-early][Exiting the Loop Early]]).

  Except when using accumulating loop commands ([[#accumulation-commands][Accumulation Commands]]), return
  values must be stated explicitly, either as an early return in the loop body
  via the =return= or =return-from= commands, or as part of the =finally-return=
  macro argument.  ~nil~ is returned by default.

  The macro is configurable.  One can add custom commands ([[#adding-custom-commands][Custom Commands]]), add
  custom command aliases ([[#custom-aliases][Custom Aliases]]), and specify macro options for a
  particular loop ([[#flags][Using Flags]]).  Each of these ideas is explained in detail
  later in this document.

* Special Macro Arguments
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: macro-arguments
  :DESCRIPTION: Creating the environment of the loop.
  :END:

  #+cindex: special macro argument
  There are only a few special macro arguments. One, an unquoted symbol, is
  taken as the loop's name. The others, listed below, are parenthesized
  expressions that begin with a keyword or one of their aliases.

  If a macro argument does not match one of these special few, ~loopy~ will
  attempt to interpret it as a loop command, and signal an error if that fails.

  These special macro arguments are always processed before loop commands,
  regardless of the order of the arguments passed to ~loopy~.

  #+findex: with, let*
  - =with=, =let*=, =init= :: Declare variables before the loop, in order.  This
    can also be used to initialize variables referenced by loop commands.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; => (4 5 6)
      (loopy
       (with (a 1)          ; Set `a' to 1.
             (b (1+ a)))    ; Set `b' to 1+1=2.
       (list i '(1 2 3))    ; Bind `i' to elements of the list.
       (collect (+ i a b))) ; Collect sum of `a', `b', and each `i' into a list.

      ;; => 16
      (loopy
       (let* (my-sum 10))       ; Bind `my-sum' to 10.
       (list i '(1 2 3))        ; Bind `i' to elements of the list.
       (sum my-sum i)           ; Set `my-sum' to `i' + `my-sum'.
       (finally-return my-sum)) ; Return the value of `my-sum'.
    #+end_src

  #+findex: without, no-init
  - =without=, =no-with=, =no-init= :: Variables that ~loopy~ should not try to
    initialize.  ~loopy~ tries to initialize all of the variables that it uses
    in a ~let~-like form, but that isn’t always desired.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; Without `without', `loopy' would try to initialize `a' to nil, which would
      ;; overwrite the value of 5 above.

      (let ((a 5))
        (loopy (without a)        ; Don't initialize `a'.
               (until (zerop a))  ; Leave loop when `a' equals 0.
               (collect a)        ; Collect the value of `a' into a list.

                        (setq b (1+ b))) ; Add 1 to `b'.
             (list i '(1 2 3))           ; Set `i' to each element in the list.

    #+end_src

  #+findex: after-do, after, else-do, else
  - =after-do=, =after=, =else-do=, =else= :: Run Lisp expressions after the
    loop successfully completes.  This is similar to Python’s ~else~ statement
    following a ~for~ or ~while~ loop.

              ;; The macro already return `nil' by default,
              ;; but one can still use `cl-return' to be more explicit.
              (cl-return nil)))

      ;; Messages that an odd number was found:
      ;; => t
      (loopy (list i '(2 4 5 8))

              (+ i 7)))
    #+end_src

  #+findex: finally-return
  - =finally-return= :: Return a value, regardless of how the loop completes.
    These arguments override any explicit return values given in commands like
    =return= and =return-from=, as well as any implicit return values that can
    be created by accumulation commands.

    Specifying multiple values is the same as returning a list of those values,
    which is useful when using features like ~seq-let~, ~pcase-let~, and
    ~cl-destructuring-bind~.

      ;; To be clear, the below code would be better expressed as
      ;; `(loopy (return 1 2 3))'.  In the below example,
      ;; the command `leave' is used to avoid an infinite loop.
      ;;
      ;; => (1 2 3)
      (loopy (leave)  ; Immediately leave the loop.

    #+end_src

  #+findex: finally-protect, finally-protected
  - =finally-protect=, =finally-protected= :: Wrap the loop in ~unwind-protect~
    (not to be confused with ~condition-case~).  The arguments to this special
    macro argument (which are Lisp expressions) can access the variables used by
    the loop.

    Signaling an error will prevent the loop from returning a value.  This
    special macro argument does not prevent that error from being signaled, and
    is only meant to help avoid lingering effects that might arise from
    unplanned stops of the loop's execution.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp

    For example, one can opt to use a different destructuring system, such as

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; Use Dash for destructuring:

    #+end_src

  #+findex: accum-opt
  - =accum-opt=, =opt-accum= :: Accumulation variables whose use should be
    optimized ([[#optimized-accums]]).  ~loopy~ produces efficient code without too
    many assumptions, but this special macro argument allows for more control.

  #+findex: wrap
  - =wrap= :: A list of forms in which to wrap the loop itself (i.e., not
    =before-do=, =after-do=, or anything else).  Each form can be either a list
    or a symbol.  If a list, the loop is inserted into the end of the list.  If
    a symbol, it is first converted to a list of 1 element before inserting the
    loop at the end of the list.  This special macro argument is similar in use
    to the Emacs Lisp macro ~thread-last~, except that forms listed first are
    applied last, as in normal Lisp code.

    The main difference between using this macro argument instead of just
    writing the function calls normally is that these forms can access variables
    initialized by the macro and that they occur after the code in =before-do=
    is run.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (loopy (wrap (let ((a 1)))
                   save-match-data)
             ...)

      ;; Similar to
      (let ((a 1))
        (save-match-data
          (loopy ...)))

      ;; => 6
      (loopy (with (a 1))
             (before-do (cl-incf a 2))
             (wrap (progn (setq a (* 2 a))))
             (return a))
    #+end_src

  As stated above, all other expressions will be considered loop commands
  ([[#loop-commands][Loop Commands]]).


  #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Note
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  For convenience, the ~while~-loop that ~loopy~ creates is wrapped by a
  ~cl-block~.  Naming the loop names this block, which is created /after/
  initializing variables.

  The two special macro arguments =before-do= and =after-do= (and their aliases)
  also occur within this ~cl-block~, before and after the loop, respectively.
  This has 2 consequences:

  1. Using ~cl-return~ in =before-do= will prevent the both loop and =after-do=
     code from running.

  2. Using ~cl-return~ or an early exit command ([[#exiting-the-loop-early][Early Exit]]) in the loop will
     prevent the =after-do= code from running.  For this reason, =after-do= is
     run if and only if the loop completes successfully, hence the alias
     =else-do= and the similarity to Python's ~else~ statement when used with
     loops.

  These three sections (=before-do=, =after-do=, and the ~while~-loop itself)
  are the only structures that occur within the ~cl-block~.  Using ~cl-return~
  in =before-do=, for example, will not stop code in =finally-do= from running
  or values listed in =finally-return= from being returned.

* Loop Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: loop-commands
:DESCRIPTION: The main features of `loopy'.
:END:

#+cindex: loop command
If a macro argument does not match one of the previously listed special macro
arguments ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]), ~loopy~ will attempt to treat it as a loop
command.  Loop commands are only valid as a top-level argument to the macro, or
inside another loop command.

Therefore, these macro calls are valid:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect coll i)
         ;; Special macro argument:
         (finally-return coll))

  ;; Implicit accumulation variable and implicit return value:
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i))
#+END_SRC

and this is not:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (loopy (with (list i '(1 2 3)))
         (finally-return (collect coll i)))
#+END_SRC

Trying to use loop commands in places where they don't belong will result in
errors when the code is evaluated.

You should keep in mind that commands are evaluated in order.  This means that
attempting to do something like the below example might not do what you expect,
as =i= is assigned a value from the list after collecting =i= into =coll=.

#+caption: An example of how loop commands are evaluated in order.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; => (nil 1 2)
  (loopy (collect coll i)
         (list i '(1 2 3))
         (finally-return coll))
#+END_SRC

For convenience and understanding, the same command might have multiple names,
called {{{dfn(aliases)}}}.  For example, the command =set= has an alias =expr=,
because =set= is used to /set/ a variable to the value of an /expression/.
Similary, the =array= command has the alias =string=, because the =array=
command can be used to iterate through the elements of an array or string[fn:1].
You can define custom aliases using the macro ~loopy-defalias~ ([[#custom-aliases][Custom Aliases]]).

Similar to other libraries, many commands have an alias of the present
participle form (the "-ing" form).  A few examples are seen in the table below.

| Command   | "-ing" Alias |
|-----------+--------------|
| =set=     | =setting=    |
| =list=    | =listing=    |
| =collect= | =collecting= |
| =numbers= | =numbering=  |

Some commands take optional keyword arguments.  For example, the command =list=
can take a function argument following the keyword =:by=, which affects how that
iterates through the elements in the list.

For simplicity, the commands are described using the following notation:

- If a command has multiple names, the names are separated by a vertical bar,
  such as in =set|expr=.
- =VAR= is an unquoted symbol that will be used as a variable name, such as =i=
  in =(list i my-list)=.
- =FUNC= is a quoted Lisp function name, such as ~#'my-func~ or ~'my-func~, a
  variable whose value is a function, or a ~lambda~ expression.
- =NAME= is an unquoted name of a loop (or, more accurately, of a =cl-block=).
- =EXPR= is a single Lisp expression, such as =(+ 1 2)=, ='(1 2 3)=, =my-var=,
  or =(some-function my-var)=.  =EXPRS= means multiple expressions.  Really, we
  are concerned with the value of the expression, not the expression itself.
- =CMD= is a loop command, as opposed to a normal Lisp expression.
  =(list i '(1 2 3))=, =(cycle 5)=, and =(return-from outer-loop 7)=
  are examples of loop commands.  =CMDS= means multiple commands.
- Optional arguments are surround by brackets.  =[EXPR]= is an optional
  expression, and =[CMD]= is an optional command.  By extension, =[EXPRS]= is
  equivalent to =[EXPR [EXPR [...]]]=, and =[CMDS]= to =[CMD [CMD [...]]]=.
- Optional keyword arguments are shown as =&key key1 key2 ...=, where =key1=,
  =key2=, and so on are the literal keywords.  Just like in normal Lisp
  functions, keywords must be prefixed by a colon (":").  For example, the
  iteration command =list= has a keyword argument =by=, which can be given a
  value using =:by SOME-EXPRESSION=.


Generally, =VAR= is initialized to ~nil~, but not always.  This document tries
to note when that is not the case.

** Basic Destructuring
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: basic-destructuring
:DESCRIPTION: How to destructure variables and values in loop commands.
:END:

#+cindex: variable destructuring
Similar to features like ~seq-let~, ~cl-destructuring-bind~, and ~pcase-let~,
~loopy~ is capable of destructuring values when assigning values to variables.
Destructuring in Loopy is similar to, but more featureful than, what is
provided in =cl-lib=.

Some differences include:
- Destructuring arrays
- Destructuring in accumulation commands ([[#accumulation-commands]])
- Destructuring in commands iterating through ~setf~-able places in a sequence
  ([[#sequence-reference-iteration]])

In addition to what can be done in loop commands, several macros are available
for using Loopy's destructuring outside of ~loopy~ loops ([[#destr-macros]]).

This section describes the basic built-in destructuring used by most loop
commands, such as =set= and =list=.  Destructuring in accumulation commands and
sequence reference commands works slightly differently, and is described more in
those sections.

The last thing to note is that ~loopy~ loops can be made to use alternative
destructuring systems, such as ~seq-let~ or ~pcase-let~.  This is done by using
the =flag= special macro argument ([[#flags]]).  If you are familiar with the
package =dash= [fn:dash] and its Clojure-style destructuring, consider trying
the flag =dash= provided by the package =loopy-dash=.

Below are two examples of destructuring in ~cl-loop~ and ~loopy~.

#+caption: Destructuring values in a list.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (cl-loop for (i . j) in '((1 . 2) (3 . 4))
           collect i
           collect j)

  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (loopy (list (i . j) '((1 . 2) (3 . 4)))
         (collect i)
         (collect j))
#+end_src

#+caption: Destructuring values in assignment.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (cl-loop for elem in '((1 . 2) (3 . 4))
           for (i . j) = elem
           collect i
           collect j)

  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (loopy (list elem '((1 . 2) (3 . 4)))
         (set (i . j) elem)
         (collect i)
         (collect j))
#+end_src


You can use destructured assignment by passing an unquoted sequence of symbols
as the =VAR= argument of a loop command.  Loopy supports destructuring lists and
arrays (which includes strings and vectors).
- To destructure lists, use a list.
- To destructure arrays, use a vector.

This sequence of symbols can be shorter than the destructured sequence, /but not
longer/.  If shorter, the unassigned elements of the list are simply ignored.

An element in the sequence =VAR= can be one of the following:

- A positional variable which will be bound to the corresponding element in the
  sequence.  These variables can themselves be sequences, but must be of the
  correct type.  Unlike ~seq-let~, Loopy does not yet have a generic syntax for
  sequences.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
    (loopy (list [i (j k)] '([1 (2 3)] [4 (5 6)]))
           (collect (list i j k)))
  #+end_src

- The symbol =_=: The symbol =_= means to avoid creating a variable.  This can
  be more efficient.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Only create the variables `a' and `c'.
    (loopy (list (a _ c) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
           (collect (list a c)))

    ;; These two destructurings do the same thing,
    ;; and only bind the variable `a':
    (loopy (array (a) [(1 2) (3 4)])
           (collect a))

    (loopy (array (a . _) [(1 2) (3 4)])
           (collect a))
  #+end_src

- The symbol =&whole=: If =&whole= is the first element in the sequence, then
  the second element of the sequence names a variable that holds the entire
  value of what is destructured.

  This is the same as when used in a CL ~lambda~ list.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; See that the variable `both' holds the value of the entire
    ;; list element:
    ;; => (((1 2) 1 2)
    ;;     ((3 4) 3 4))
    (loopy (list (&whole both i j)  '((1 2) (3 4)))
           (collect (list both i j)))

    (mapcar (cl-function (lambda ((&whole both i j))
                           (list both i j)))
            '((1 2) (3 4)))
  #+end_src

- The symbol =&rest=: A variable named after =&rest= contains the remaining
  elements of the destructured value.  When destructuring lists, one can
  alternatively use dotted notation.  These variables can themselves be
  sequences.

  This is the same as when used in ~seq-let~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((1 [2 3]) (4 [5 6]))
    (loopy (list [i &rest j] '([1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
           (collect (list i j)))

    ;; => ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
    (loopy (list [i &rest [j k]] '([1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
           (collect (list i j k)))

    ;; => ((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6)))
    (loopy (list (i . j) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
           (collect (list i j)))

    ;; Works the same as above:
    (loopy (list (i &rest j) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
           (collect (list i j)))

    ;; The above using `seq-let':
    (let ((result))
      (dolist (elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
        (seq-let [i &rest j] elem
          (push (list i j) result)))
      (reverse result))
  #+end_src

- The symbol =&key= or =&keys=: Variables named after =&key= are transformed
  into keys whose values will be sought using ~plist-get~, which returns ~nil~
  if the key isn't found in the list.

  Currently, only lists support this destructuring.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((1 2 nil) (4 5 nil))
    (loopy (list (&key a b missing) '((:b 2 :c 3 :a 1)
                                      (:a 4 :b 5 :c 6)))
           (collect (list a b missing)))
  #+end_src

  If the key is not in the list, a default value can be provided by using a
  two-item list of the variable and the default value.  If a default value is
  provided, then keys are sought using ~plist-member~ so that a value of ~nil~
  for a key is not the same as a missing key.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Note that `nil' is not the same as a missing value.
    ;; => ((1 2 nil 25) (4 5 24 25))
    (loopy (list (&key a b (c 24) (missing 25)) '((:b 2 :c nil :a 1)
                                                  (:a 4 :b 5)))
           (collect (list a b c missing)))
  #+end_src

  Keys are sought in values after those bound to positional variables, which can
  be the same values bound to the variable named by =&rest= when both are
  used.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Keys are only sought after positional variables:
    ;; => ((1 2 :k1 'ignored 3))
    (loopy (array (a b c d &key k1) [(1 2 :k1 'ignored :k1 3)])
           (collect (list a b c d k1)))

    ;; If `&rest' is used, keys are sought only in that variable:
    ;; => ((1 (:k1 3) 3))
    (loopy (array (a &rest b &key k1) [(1 :k1 3)])
           (collect (list a b k1)))
  #+end_src

  =&key= and =&rest= can be used in any order, but =&key= must come before
  the dot in dotted lists.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((1 (:k1 3) 3))
    (loopy (array (a &rest b &key k1) [(1 :k1 3)])
           (collect (list a b k1)))

    (loopy (array (a &key k1 &rest b) [(1 :k1 3)])
           (collect (list a b k1)))

    (loopy (array (a &key k1 . b) [(1 :k1 3)])
           (collect (list a b k1)))
  #+end_src

     If =INIT= is provided, use that as the initial value of =VAR=.  This could
     also be achieved by specifying a value using the =with= special macro
     argument.  When destructuring, each variable is initialized to =INIT=, not
     a destructured part of =INIT=.

     #+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Note
     #+begin_quote
     =set= does /not/ behave the same as ~setq~ in all situations.

     While =set= can take multiple arguments, it only assigns the value of one
     expression to one variable during each iteration of the loop (unless using
     destructuring).  It cannot take pairs of variables and values in the same
     way that ~setq~ does.

     Furthermore, variables assigned by =set= (and other commands) are by
     default ~let~-bound around the loop and generally initialized to ~nil~.
     This means that doing =(set VAR EXPR)= will not, by default, affect
     variables outside of the loop in the same way that using =(do (setq VAR
     EXPR))= would.

** Iteration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: iteration-and-looping-commands
:DESCRIPTION: Iterating through sequences, etc.
:END:

Iteration commands bind local variables and determine when the loop ends.  If no
command sets an ending condition, then the loop runs forever.  Infinite loops
can be exited by using early-exit commands ([[#exiting-the-loop-early]]) or boolean
commands ([[#boolean-commands]]).

Iteration commands must occur in the top level of the ~loopy~ form or in a
=sub-loop= command.  Trying to do something like the below will signal an error.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Signals an error:
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3 4 5))
         (when (cl-evenp i)
           ;; Can't use `list' in a `when'.
           ;; Will signal an error.
           (list j '(6 7 8 9 10))
           (collect j)))
#+end_src


In ~loopy~, iteration commands are named after what they iterate through.  For
example, the =array= and =list= commands iterate through the elements of arrays
and lists, respectively.

  #+END_SRC


*** Numeric Iteration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: numeric-iteration
:DESCRIPTION: Iterating through numbers.
:END:

For iterating through numbers, there is the general =nums= command, and its
variants =nums-up= and =nums-down=.

#+findex: num, nums, number, numbers
- =(nums|num|number|numbers VAR [START [END] [STEP]] &key KEYS)= :: Iterate
  through numbers.  =KEYS= is one or several of =from=, =upfrom=, =downfrom=,
  =to=, =upto=, =downto=, =above=, =below=, and =by=.

  The command =nums= is used to iterate through numbers.  For example, =(nums i
  1 10)= is similar to =(list i (number-sequence 1 10))=, and =(nums i 3)= is
  similar to =(set i 3 (1+ i))=.

  To balance convenience and similarity to other commands, =nums= has a flexible
  argument list.  In its most basic form, it uses no keywords and takes a
  starting value and an ending value.  The ending value is inclusive.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (1 2 3 4 5)
    (loopy (nums i 1 5)
           (collect i))
  #+end_src

  If the ending value is not given, then the value is incremented by 1 without
  end.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16)
    (loopy (cycle 10)
           (nums i 7)
           (collect i))
  #+end_src

  To specify the step size, one can use an optional third argument (like in
  Python's ~range~) or the keyword =:by= (like in ~cl-loop~). The value of the
  optional third argument can be positive or negative. /However/, in keeping
  with ~cl-loop~, the value for =:by= should always be positive; other keyword
  arguments then control whether the variable is incremented or decremented.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (1 3 5)
    (loopy (nums i 1 5 2)
           (collect i))

    ;; => (1 3 5)
    (loopy (nums i 1 5 :by 2)
           (collect i))

    ;; => (7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25)
    (loopy (cycle 10)
           (nums i 7 :by 2)
           (collect i))

    ;; => (1 2.5 4.0)
    (loopy (nums i 1 5 :by 1.5)
           (collect i))
  #+end_src

  By default, the variable's value starts at 0 and increases by 1.  To specify
  that the value should be increasing or decreasing when using the =:by=
  keyword, one can use the keywords =:downfrom=, =:downto=, =:upfrom=, and
  =:upto=.  The keywords =:from= and =:to= don't by themselves specify a
  direction.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => (3 2 1)
    (loopy (cycle 3)
           (nums i :downfrom 3)
           (collect i))

    ;; => (0 -1 -2 -3)

If you prefer using positional arguments to keyword arguments, you can use the
commands =nums-up= and =nums-down= to specify directions.  These commands are
simple wrappers of the above =nums= command.

    ;; => (10 8 6 4 2)
    (loopy (nums-down i 10 1 2)
           (collect i))
  #+end_src

#+findix: nums-up, numbers-up
- =(nums-up|numsup|numbers-up VAR START [END] &key by)= :: Equivalent to =(nums

*** Sequence Iteration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sequence-iteration
:DESCRIPTION: Iterating through sequences.
:END:

These commands provide various ways to iterate through sequences
([[info:elisp#Sequences Arrays Vectors]]).

#+cindex: sequence element distribution
Instead of iterating through just one sequence, the =array=, =list=, and =seq=
commands can be given multiple sequences of various sizes.  In such cases, the
elements of the sequences are {{{dfn(distributed)}}}, like in the distributive
property from mathematics.  A new sequence of distributed elements is created
before the loop runs, and that sequence is used for iteration instead of the
source sequences.  As seen in the below example, the resulting behavior is
similar to that of nested loops.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((1 3 6) (1 4 6) (1 5 6) (2 3 6) (2 4 6) (2 5 6))
  (loopy (list i '(1 2) '(3 4 5) '(6))
         (collect i))

  ;; Gives the same result as this
  (let ((result nil))
    (dolist (i '(1 2))
      (dolist (j '(3 4 5))
        (dolist (k '(6))
          (push (list i j k) result))))
    (nreverse result))

  ;; and this
  (cl-loop for i in '(1 2)
           append (cl-loop for j in '(3 4 5)
                           append (cl-loop for k in '(6)
                                           collect (list i j k))))
#+end_src


The =array= and =sequence= commands can use the same keywords as the =nums=
command ([[#numeric-iteration]]) for working with the index and choosing a range of
the sequence elements through which to iterate.  In addition to those keywords,
they also have an =index= keyword, which names the variable used to store the
accessed index during the loop.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((1 . 9) (3 . 6) (5 . 5) (7 . 3) (9 . 1))
  (loopy (array i [10 9 8 6 7 5 4 3 2 1] :from 1 :by 2 :index ind)
         (collect (cons ind i)))
#+end_src

Keep in mind that if used with sequence distribution, these keywords affect
iterating through the sequence of distributed elements.  That is, they do not
affect how said sequence is produced.  In the example below, see that ~cddr~ is
applied to the sequence of distributed elements.  It is /not/ applied to the
source sequences.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; This code creates the sequence of distributed elements
  ;; ((1 4) (1 5) (1 6) (2 4) (2 5) (2 6) (3 4) (3 5) (3 6))
  ;; and then moves through this sequence using `cddr'.
  ;;
  ;; => ((1 4) (1 6) (2 5) (3 4) (3 6))
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) :by #'cddr)
         (collect i))

  ;; Not the same as:
  ;; => ((1 4) (1 6) (3 4) (3 6))
  (loopy (list i '(1 3) '(4 6))
         (collect i))
#+end_src


#+findex: array, string
- =(array|string VAR EXPR [EXPRS] &key KEYS)= :: Loop through the
  elements of the array =EXPR=.  In Emacs Lisp, strings are arrays whose
  elements are characters.

  =KEYS= is one or several of =from=, =upfrom=, =downfrom=, =to=, =upto=,
  =downto=, =above=, =below=, =by=, and =index=.  =index= names the variable
  used to store the index being accessed.  For others, see the =nums= command.

  If multiple arrays are given, then the elements of these arrays are
  distributed into an array of lists.  In that case, the above keywords apply to
  this new, resulting array of lists.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (loopy (array i [1 2 3])
           (do (message "%d" i)))

    ;; => (1 3)

    ;; Collects the integer values representing each character.
    ;; => (97 98 99)
    (loopy (string c "abc")
           (collect c))

    ;; This is the same as using [(1 3) (1 4) (2 3) (2 4)].
    ;; => ((1 3) (1 4) (2 3) (2 4))
    (loopy (array i [1 2] [3 4])
           (collect i))

    ;; => ((1 3) (2 3))
    (loopy (array i [1 2] [3 4] :by 2)
           (collect i))
  #+END_SRC

#+findex: cons, conses

  Optionally, find the cons cells via function =by= instead of =cdr=.

#+findex: list, each
- =(list|each VAR EXPR [EXPRS] &key by)= :: Loop through each element of the

  If multiple lists are given, distribute the elements of the lists into one new
  list.  In such cases, =by= applies to the new list, not the arguments of the
  command.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 10 3)) ; Inclusive, so '(1 4 7 10).
           (do (message "%d" i)))

           (collect i))

    ;; => ((1 4) (1 6) (2 5) (3 4) (3 6))
    (loopy (list i '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) :by #'cddr)
           (collect i))
  #+END_SRC

#+findex: map, map-pairs
- =(map|map-pairs VAR EXPR &key unique)= :: Iterate through the dotted key-value
  pairs of =EXPR=, using the function ~map-pairs~ from the =map.el= library.
  This library generalizes working with association lists ("alists"), property
  lists ("plists"), hash-tables, and vectors.

  In each dotted pair assigned to =VAR=, the ~car~ is the key and the ~cdr~ is
  the value.

  By default, only the unique keys are used.  To disable this deduplication,
  pass ~nil~ to the =unique= keyword argument.

  You should not rely on the order in which the key-value pairs are found.

  These pairs are created before the loop begins.  In other words, the map
  =EXPR= is not processed progressively, but all at once.  Therefore, this
  command can have a noticeable start-up cost when working with very large maps.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((a . 1) (b . 2))
    (loopy (map pair '((a . 1) (b . 2)))
           (collect pair))

    ;; => ((a b) (1 2))
    (loopy (map (key . value) '((a . 1) (b . 2)))
           (collect keys key)
           (collect values value)
           (finally-return keys values))

    ;; => ((:a :b) (1 2))
    (loopy (map (key . value) '(:a  1 :b 2))
           (collect keys key)
           (collect values value)
           (finally-return keys values))

    ;; NOTE: For vectors, the keys are indices.
    ;; => ((0 1) (1 2))
    (loopy (map (key . value) [1 2])
           (collect keys key)
           (collect values value)
           (finally-return keys values))

    ;; => ((a b) (1 2))
    (let ((my-table (make-hash-table)))
      (puthash 'a 1 my-table)
      (puthash 'b 2 my-table)

      (loopy (map (key . value) my-table)
             (collect keys key)
             (collect values value)
             (finally-return keys values)))
  #+end_src

  Depending on how a map is created, a map might repeat a key multiple times.
  Currently, the function ~map-pairs~ returns such keys.  By default, the
  command =map-pairs= ignores such duplicate keys.  This is for two reasons:
  1. This is more consistent with the command =map-ref=, for which such
     duplicates are more likely to cause errors.
  2. For maps that can have duplicate keys (alists, plists, etc.), there are
     already other iteration commands (=list=, =cons=, etc.) that explicitly
     include the duplicates.

  Again, this can be disabled by setting =unique= to nil.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; A comparison of setting the `unique' key to nil:
    ;;
    ;; => ((a 1) (a 2) (b 3))
    (loopy (map (key . val) '((a . 1) (a . 2) (b . 3)) :unique nil)
           (collect (list key val)))

    ;; In this case, `list' has the same result:
    ;; => ((a 1) (a 2) (b 3))
    (loopy (list (key . val) '((a . 1) (a . 2) (b . 3)))
           (collect (list key val)))

    ;; => ((:a 1) (:a 2) (:b 3))
    (loopy (map (key . val) '(:a 1 :a 2 :b 3) :unique nil)
           (collect (list key val)))

    ;; In this case, `cons' has the same result:
    ;; => ((:a 1) (:a 2) (:b 3))
    (loopy (cons (key val) '(:a 1 :a 2 :b 3) :by #'cddr)
           (collect (list key val)))
  #+end_src

#+findex: seq, sequence
- =(seq|sequence VAR EXPR [EXPRS] &key KEYS)= :: Loop through the sequence
  =EXPR=, binding =VAR= to the elements of the sequence.  This is a more generic
  form of the commands =list= and =array=, though it is somewhat less efficient.

  =KEYS= is one or several of =from=, =upfrom=, =downfrom=, =to=, =upto=,
  =downto=, =above=, =below=, =by=, and =index=.  =index= names the variable
  used to store the index being accessed.  For others, see the =nums= command.

  If multiple sequences are given, then these keyword arguments apply to the
  resulting sequence of distributed elements.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; => (1 2 3)
    (loopy (seq i [1 2 3])
           (collect coll i)

*** Sequence Index Iteration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sequence-index-iteration
    :DESCRIPTION: Iterating through indices without accessing values.
    :END:

    This command is for iterating through a sequence's indices without accessing
    the actual values of that sequence.  This is helpful if you know ahead of
    time that you are only interested in a small subset of the sequence's
    elements.

    As with the =array= and =seq= commands, the =seq-index= command can use the
    same keywords as the =nums= command ([[#numeric-iteration]]) for working with
    the index and choosing a range of the sequence elements through which to
    iterate.

    #+findex: seq-index, seqi, array-index, arrayi, list-index, listi, string-index, stringi
    - =(seq-index VAR EXPR &key KEYS)= :: Iterate through the indices of =EXPR=.

      There is only one implementation of this command; there are no
      type-specific versions.  For clarity and convenience, this command has the
      aliases =array-index=, =list-index=, and =string-index=.  In keeping with
      aliases like =seqf= for the =seq-ref= command, this command also has the
      aliases =seqi=, =arrayi=, =listi=, and =stringi=.

      =KEYS= is one or several of =from=, =upfrom=, =downfrom=, =to=, =upto=,
      =downto=, =above=, =below=, and =by=.  For their meaning, see the =nums=
      command.  This command is very similar to =nums=, except that it can
      automatically end the loop when the final element is reached.  With
      =nums=, one would first need to explicitly calculate the length of the
      sequence.

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; => (97 98 99 100 101 102)
        (loopy (with (my-string "abcdef"))
               (string-index idx my-string)
               (collect (aref my-string idx)))

        ;; Works the same as
        (loopy (with (my-string "abcdef"))

               (collect (aref my-string idx)))
      #+end_src

      This command does not support destructuring.

*** Sequence Reference Iteration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sequence-reference-iteration
    :DESCRIPTION: Iterating through places/fields in sequences.
    :END:

    These commands all iterate through ~setf~-able places as generalized
    variables ([[info:elisp#Generalized Variables]]).  These generalized variables
    are commonly called "references", "fields", or "places".  The below example
    demonstrates using ~(nth 1 my-list)~ and ~(aref my-array 1)~ as ~setf~-able
    places.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; => (1 99 3 4 5)
      (let ((my-list '(1 2 3 4 5)))
        (setf (nth 1 my-list) 99)
        my-list)

      ;; => [(1 2 3) (4 . 99)]
      (let ((my-array [(1 2 3) (4 5 6)]))
        (setf (cdr (aref my-array 1)) 99)
        my-array)
    #+end_src

    Like other commands, "field" or "reference" commands can also use
    destructuring, in which case the fields/places of the sequence are
    destructured into "sub-fields", like the ~cdr~ of the second array element
    in the example above.

    #+attr_texinfo: :tag Caution
    #+begin_quote
    Be aware that using ~setf~ on an array sub-sequence named by =&rest=
    will only overwrite values, not truncate or grow the array.
    #+end_quote

    #+attr_texinfo: :tag Warning
    #+begin_quote
    Unfortunately, not all kinds of recursive destructuring work on references.
    This is a limitation of how generic setters are implemented, and is not
    limited to ~loopy~.

    Currently, the variable after =&rest= in arrays cannot be recursive.
    #+end_quote

    As with the =array= and =seq= commands, the =array-ref= and =seq-ref=
    commands can use the same keywords as the =nums= command
    ([[#numeric-iteration]]) for working with the index and choosing a range of the
    sequence elements through which to iterate.  In addition to those keywords,
    they also have an =index= keyword, which names the variable used to store
    the accessed index during the loop.

      =downto=, =above=, =below=, =by=, and =index=.  =index= names the variable

      map =EXPR=, binding =VAR= as a ~setf~-able place.  Like the command =map=,
      this command uses the =map.el= library.

      =key= is a variable in which to store the current key for the ~setf~-able
      place referred to by =VAR=.  This is similar to the =index= keyword
      parameter of other commands.

      Like in the command =map=, the keys of the map are generated before the
      loop is run, which can be expensive for large maps.

      Similar to =map=, any duplicate keys are ignored by default.  This can be
      disabled by setting the =unique= keyword argument to nil, though note that
      using such duplicate keys will still refer to the value of the first
      occurence.  There is no way to use a duplicate key to refer to the
      duplicate's value.

** Accumulation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: accumulation-commands
   :DESCRIPTION: Accumulating values into new sequences, aggregating values, etc.
   :END:

   Accumulation commands are used to accumulate or aggregate values into a
   variable, such as creating a list of values or summing the elements in
   a sequence.

   If needed, you can refer to the same accumulation variable in multiple
   accumulation commands.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 6 2 7 3 8)
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect coll i)
            (collect coll (+ i 5))
            (finally-return coll))
   #+end_src

   #+attr_texinfo: :tag Note
   #+begin_quote
   Keep in mind that it is an error to modify accumulation variables outside of
   accumulation commands.  This restriction allows accumulations to be much
   faster.
   #+end_quote

   Like with other loop commands, variables created by accumulation commands
   (such as =coll= in the above example) are initialized to ~nil~ unless
   stated otherwise.

   #+cindex: accumulation destructuring
   Similar to iteration commands, accumulation commands can also use
   destructuring.  In accumulation commands, the values resulting from
   destructuring are accumulated, instead of the destructured value.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (collect (coll1 coll2 coll3) elem)
            (finally-return coll1 coll2 coll3))

     ;; => (5 7 9)
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (sum (sum1 sum2 sum3) elem)
            (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3))

     ;; Returns the same values as above.
     (loopy (list elem '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
            (set sum1 (cl-first elem)  (+ sum1 (cl-first elem)))
            (set sum2 (cl-second elem) (+ sum2 (cl-second elem)))
            (set sum3 (cl-third elem)  (+ sum3 (cl-third elem)))
            (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3))
   #+end_src


   #+cindex: implied/implicit accumulation results
   #+vindex: loopy-result
   Like in ~cl-loop~, you do not need to supply a variable name to accumulation
   commands.  If no accumulation variable is given, accumulation commands will
   use the variable ~loopy-result~.  This variable is accessible in the
   =after-do=, =finally-do=, and =finally-return= special macro arguments.  You
   should not attempt to modify this variable.  If you wish to override what
   would be returned by the macro, simply use the =finally-return= macro
   argument as you normally would.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 2 3)
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i)
            (after-do (cl-return loopy-result)))

     ;; => (1 2 3)
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i)
            (finally-return loopy-result))

     ;; => (0 1 2 3)
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i)
            (else-do (push 0 loopy-result)
                     (cl-return loopy-result)))

     ;; => (0 1 2 3)
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i)
            (finally-do (push 0 loopy-result))
            (finally-return loopy-result))
   #+end_src

   #+cindex: implied/implicit return values
   Using an accumulation command without naming a variable implies a return
   value for the macro, which you can override using the =return= and
   =return-from= loop commands or the =finally-return= macro argument.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 2 3)
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i))

     ;; => overridden
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i)
            (finally-return 'overridden))
   #+end_src


   Be aware that explicitly named accumulation variables do not affect this
   implied return value.  Such values must be returned explicitly, or they will
   be ignored when the macro returns a values.  This limitation is needed for
   more consistently handling the complexity that comes from allowing unknown
   kinds of destructuring via the alternative destructuring systems.  This may
   change in the future.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 2 3)
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i)
            (collect my-other-collection (* 2 i))
            (collect (a b) (list i (* 2 i))))
   #+end_src

   Therefore, when mixing implicit and explicit accumulation variables, you must
   use the =finally-return= special macro argument to return all of the
   accumulation results.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => ((1 2 3) (2 4 6) (1 2 3) (2 4 6))
     (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
            (collect i)
            (collect my-other-collection (* 2 i))
            (collect (a b) (list i (* 2 i)))
            (finally-return loopy-result
                            my-other-collection
                            a b))
   #+end_src

   When using implied variables, multiple accumulation commands will use the
   same variable (that is, they will all accumulate into ~loopy-result~).  You
   should ensure that such accumulations are actually compatible, otherwise
   ~loopy~ will raise an error.  For example, you should not try to accumulate
   =collect= results and =sum= results into the same variable, as you cannot use
   a list as a number.  On the other hand, =sum= and =multiply= are compatible,
   since they both act on numbers.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (3 2 1 11 12 13)
     (loopy (nums i 1 3)
            (collect i :at start)
            (collect (+ i 10) :at end))

     ;; Algebraic style: ((((0 + 1) * 1) + 2) * 2 + 3) * 3 = 27
     ;; RPN style: 0 1 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 3 *
     ;; => 27
     (loopy (nums i 1 3)
            (sum i)
            (multiply i))

     ;; As an aside, note the difference between summing first and multiplying
     ;; first.  Besides the order of operations, variables that are summed first
     ;; are initialized to 0, while variables that are multiplied first
     ;; are initialized to 1.
     ;;
     ;; => 21
     (loopy (nums i 1 3)
            (multiply i)
            (sum i))
   #+end_src

   #+attr_texinfo: :tag Warning
   #+begin_quote
   You should not try to access implied accumulation results (e.g.,
   ~loopy-result~) while the loop is running.  Implied results are only required
   to be correct after the loop ends (before code in =else-do= is run), allowing
   for more efficient code.

   Furthermore, because using a =return= or =return-from= command overrides
   implied return values, using these commands can prevent implied accumulation
   results from being finalized.  Using the =leave= command, which exits the
   loop without returning a value, does not affect the correctness of implied
   results.
   #+end_quote

   By default, one must specify accumulation variables in order to accumulate
   into separate values.  If, for some reason, you wish to always used implied
   variables during a loop, you can enable the =split= flag ([[#flags]]).
   This flag makes ~loopy~ generate a unique implied variable for each
   accumulation command.

   When the =split= flag is enabled and after the loop completes, each of these
   split accumulation variables will be part of the list ~loopy-result~,
   appearing in the same order as their respective commands in the macro's
   arguments.  In the example below, note that the result of ~(collect i)~ is
   the first element of ~loopy-result~, even though the collection happens
   /after/ the first summation when the loop runs.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => ((2 4) 15)
     (loopy (flag split)
            (nums i 1 5)
            (when (cl-evenp i)
              (collect i))
            (sum i)
            ;; NOTE: This `finally-return' isn't needed, as `loopy-result'
            ;; is already the implied return value.
            (finally-return loopy-result))
   #+end_src

***  Accumulation Commands

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword arguments
   Some accumulation commands have optional keyword parameters, which are listed
   in the command's definition.  To avoid repetition, the common parameters are
   all described below.

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword at
   - =at= :: Where to place a value.  One of =end=, =start=, or =beginning=
     (equivalent to =start=).  If ungiven, defaults to =end=.  These positions
     need not be quoted.

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword into
   - =into= :: An alternative way to specify the variable into which to
     accumulate values.  One would normally just give =VAR= as the first
     argument of the loop command, but if you wish, you can use this keyword
     argument for a more ~cl-loop~-like syntax.

     As all accumulation commands support this keyword, it is not listed in
     any command definition.

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword test
   - =test= :: A function of two arguments, usually used to test for equality.
     Most tests default to ~equal~, like in other Emacs Lisp libraries.  This is
     different from ~cl-lib~, which mimics Common Lisp and prefers using ~eql~.

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword key
   - =key= :: A function of one argument, used to transform the inputs of
     =test=.

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword init
   - =init= :: The initial value of =VAR=.  For explicitly named variables, one
     can use this argument or the =with= special macro argument.  When using the
     =split= flag, this argument is the only way to specify a non-default
     initial value.

   #+cindex: accumulation keyword result-type
   - =result-type= :: A sequence type into which =VAR= is converted /after the
     loop is over/.  These types need not be quoted.  For example, ='vector= and
     =vector= are both valid ways to specify the vector data type.

     This argument can be more convenient than writing out a call to ~cl-coerce~
     or ~seq-into~.

   The arguments to the =test= and =key= parameters can be quoted functions or
   variables, just like when using ~cl-union~, ~cl-adjoin~, and so on.  ~loopy~
   knows how to expand efficiently for either case.

   #+attr_texinfo: :tag Note
   #+begin_quote
   You will notice that each accumulation command has an alias of the command
   name in the present participle form (the "-ing" form).

   For example, instead of "min" or "minimize", you can use "minning" or
   "minimizing".  Instead of "sum" and "append", you can use "summing" and
   "appending".  This is similar to the behavior of ~cl-loop~, and helps to
   avoid name collisions when using the ~loopy-iter~ macro
   ([[#loopy-iter][The ~loopy-iter~ Macro]]).

   The available accumulation commands are:

   #+findex: accumulate
   - =(accumulate|accumulating VAR EXPR FUNC &key init)= :: Accumulate the
     result of applying function =FUNC= to =EXPR= and =VAR=.  =EXPR= and =VAR=
     are used as the first and second arguments to =FUNC=, respectively.

     This is a generic accumulation command in case the others don't meet your
     needs.  It is similar in effect to using the command =expr=.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       ;; Call `(cons i my-accum)'
       ;;
       ;; => (2 1)

              (accumulate my-accum i #'cons :init nil)

       ;; Works mostly the same as the above:

              (finally-return accum1 accum2))
     #+end_src

     This command also has the alias =callf2=.  It is similar to using the
     function ~cl-callf2~, except that the function argument is given last and
     must be quoted.  This alias is intended to help users remember argument
     order.

***  Optimizing Accumulations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: optimized-accums
:DESCRIPTION: Producing efficient accumulations
:END:

#+cindex: optimizing accumulations
By default, named accumulation variables (excluding the automatically named
~loopy-result~) are accessible during the loop, and their values are always
correct during execution.  For example, lists are always in the correct order,
even when constructing linked lists in the reverse order would be more
efficient.

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; Note how `coll' is always in the correct order:
  ;; => ((1 2 3)
  ;;     ((1) (1 2) (1 2 3)))
  (loopy (array i [1 2 3])
         (collect coll i)
         (collect intermediate-values (copy-sequence coll))
         (finally-return coll intermediate-values))
#+end_src

Implied accumulation variables do not have the requirement of always being in
the correct order, so commands using such variables can produce more efficient
code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Similar in efficiency to the below:
  ;; => (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 ...)
  (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 1000))
         (collect (1+ i)))

  ;; => (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 ...)
  (let (result)
    (dolist (i (number-sequence 1 1000))
      (push (1+ i) result))
    (nreverse result))
#+end_src

The situation becomes more complex when commands place values at both sides of a
sequence.  In that case, ~loopy~ keeps track of the beginning /and/ the end
of the sequence.  ~loopy~ does /not/ merely append to the end of the resulting
list, since that would be much slower for large lists.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; `loopy' can be faster than the below `dolist' approach:
  ;; => (3 2 1 7 14 21)
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i :at start)
         (collect (* i 7) :at end))

  ;; For large accumulations, this is slower than the above:
  ;; => (3 2 1 7 14 21)
  (let (result)
    (dolist (i '(1 2 3))
      (setq result (cons i result)
            result (nconc result (list (* i 7)))))
    result)
#+end_src

In such cases, ~loopy~ will naively optimize placing values at whichever side
appears to be the most used.  In the example below, note that even though the
commands to insert values at the front of the list are never actually run,
~loopy~ will still optimize for frontal insertions.  Here, ~loopy~ simply counts
that 2 commands seem to place values at the front of the list while only 1
command seems to place values at the end.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; This code optimizes for insertions at the front of the list:
  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i :at end)
         (when nil
           (collect i :at start)
           (collect i :at start)))
#+end_src

The special macro argument =accum-opt= can be used to better control these
optimizations ([[#macro-arguments]]).  With it, you can (1) treat an explicit
variable as if it were implicit and optionally (2) specify which side of a
sequence you expect to use more.  The arguments passed to =accum-opt= are either
symbols (such as ~loopy-result~) or lists of a symbol and a position.  To be
clear, use of the variable ~loopy-result~ is always at least naively optimized
in the manner described above.

In the example below, see that
1. Accumulation into the named variable ~coll~ has been specifically optimized
   for using the end of the sequence, despite there being more commands that use
   the beginning of the sequence.
2. Because accumulation into ~coll~ has been optimized, the order of values in
   ~coll~ need not be correct during the loop.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; This code optimizes for insertions at the end of `coll':
  ;; => ((23 13 22 12 21 11 1 2 3)
  ;;     ((1 11 21) (2 1 11 21 12 22) (3 2 1 11 21 12 22 13 23)))
  (loopy (accum-opt (coll end))
         (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect coll i :at end)
         (collect coll (+ 10 i) :at start)
         (collect coll (+ 20 i) :at start)
         (collect intermediate-values (copy-sequence coll))
         (finally-return coll intermediate-values))
#+end_src


#+cindex: accum-opt vs. split
The =accump-opt= special macro argument can also be used with destructuring.
Because destructuring requires using named variables, such variables are by
default required to ordered correctly during the loop.  If you do not require
that, you are recommended to use =accum-opt= on those variables.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ((1 3)
  ;;     (2 4)
  ;;     ((1) (3 1))
  ;;     ((2) (4 2)))
  (loopy (accum-opt a b)
         (array elem [(1 2) (3 4)])
         (collect (a b) elem)
         (collect intermediate-a (copy-sequence a))
         (collect intermediate-b (copy-sequence b))
         (finally-return a b intermediate-a intermediate-b))
#+end_src

The other option, though not exactly the same, is to destructure in iteration
commands and use the =split= flag with accumulations ([[#flags]]).  Both options
remove the sorting requirements on the accumulations variables.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; The following two loops are approximately equivalent.

  ;; => ((1 4 7) (2 5 8) (3 6 9))
  (loopy (accum-opt i j k)
         (array elem [(1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9)])
         (collect (i j k) elem)
         (finally-return i j k))

  ;; => ((1 4 7) (2 5 8) (3 6 9))
  (loopy (flag split)
         (array (i j k) [(1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9)])
         (collect i)
         (collect j)
         (collect k))

** Boolean

   Boolean commands are used to test whether a condition holds true for elements

   It is incorrect to use both =thereis= and one of =always= or =never= in the

   For convenience, these commands can be passed multiple conditions.

    given, ~nil~ is returned.

   The following commands exist to properly handle sub-loops.  Depending on
   one's needs, trying to use a ~loopy~ macro call inside the =do= command could
   signal an error.  This is because arguments of the =do= command are inserted
   literally (i.e., without interpretation or modification) into the expanded
   code.  This means that using ~loopy~ inside the =do= command cannot affect
   any of the super-loop's generated code, such as variable declarations.  The
   following commands do not have that problem, because their expansions are
   processed during the expansion of the top-level macro.

              (let ((b (+ a (* 2 i))))
                (collecting b)))

  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy-iter (listing elem '(1 2 3))

#+end_src

Loop commands are treated as macros inside of ~loopy-iter~, and they are found
and expanded using ~macroexpand-all~. Hence, a loop command could overshadow the
function value of a symbol.  There are two ways to avoid such conflicts.

The first way is to use non-conflicting aliases.  Like in Iterate (and
~cl-loop~, to an extent), almost all commands in ~loopy~ have aliases in the
present participle form (the "-ing" form).  For example, Loopy provides the
command =list= with the alias =listing=.  Because the command name =list= would
conflict with the built-in Emacs Lisp function ~list~, only the command name
=listing= is supported by default.  The command name =at= (a preposition) is an
exception to this rule, though the made-up word =atting= is provided as an alias
for consistency.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; `list' is unambiguously a command name in `loopy'.
  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (loopy outer
         (list i '((1 2) (3 4)))
         (loop (list j i)
               (at outer (collect j))))

  ;; `list' would be a function.  `listing' is the command.
  ;; => (1 2 3 4)
  (loopy-iter outer
              (listing i '((1 2) (3 4)))
              ;; Equivalent to `loopy-iter':
              (looping (listing j i)
                       ;; Can use `at' instead of `atting':
                       (at outer (collecting j))))
#+end_src

#+vindex: loopy-iter-bare-commands
The command aliases recognized by ~loopy-iter~ can be customized using the user
option ~loopy-iter-bare-commands~, which is a list of symbols naming commands and
their aliases.  Again, these commands are found in the loop body using Emacs
Lisp's macro-expansion features, so adding an alias that overrides a symbol's
function definition can cause errors.  ~loopy~, whose environment is more
limited, does not have this restriction.

#+vindex: loopy-iter-bare-special-macro-arguments
The special macro arguments (and their aliases) recognized by ~loopy-iter~ can
be set in the user option ~loopy-iter-bare-special-macro-arguments~.  Some of their
built-in aliases, such as =let*= for =with=, are excluded by default.

#+cindex: loopy-iter keywords
#+vindex: loopy-iter-keywords
The first method above deals with commands that are written like functions.  If
for some reason a suitable command alias cannot be used or cannot be added to
one of the above user options, one can write the command name preceded by one of
the keywords in ~loopy-iter-keywords~.  This is the second method.

By default, the possible keywords are =for=, =accum=, =exit=, and =arg=.  These
symbols do not share a name with any built-in Emacs feature and are similar to
the keywords used by other packages.  Note that these are not Lisp "keywords"
that are prefixed with a colon, such as the =:test= in ~(cl-count ITEM SEQ :test
FUNC)~.  For example,
- the command =(listing VAR LIST)= could also be written as =(for list VAR
  LIST)=.
- the special marco argument =with=, with the alias =let*=, could also be
  written as =(arg let* (VAR EXPR) ...)=.  See that this does not conflict with
  using the ~let*~ special form.

This method recognizes all commands and their aliases in the user option
~loopy-aliases~.

#+caption: The first example, but now using keyword symbols.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (9 11 13)
  (loopy-iter (arg let* (a 7))
              (for list i '(1 2 3))
              (let ((b (+ a (* 2 i))))
                (accum collect b)))
#+end_src

While the symbols =for=, =accum=, =exit=, and =arg= are named for iteration,
accumulation, early exits, and special macro arguments, respectively, any
keyword in the user option ~loopy-iter-keywords~ can be used to identify any
loop command or special macro argument.  For example, =(accum collect a)= and
=(for collect a)= are both valid ways of referring to the =collect= loop command
in ~loopy-iter~.  Instead of =(arg let* (a 7))= in the example above, one could
also write =(exit let* (a 7))= if one really wanted to.

Restrictions on the placement of loop commands and special macro arguments
still apply in ~loopy-iter~.  For example, iteration commands must still occur
at the top level of ~loopy-iter~ or a sub-loop.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; BAD
  (loopy-iter (let ((a (progn
                         ;; ERROR: `listing' must occur at the top level.
                         (listing j '(8 9 10 11 12))
                         j)))
                (collecting a)))

  ;; GOOD
  ;; => (8 9 10 11 12)
  (loopy-iter (let ((a (progn
                         ;; NOTE: No restriction on placement of `setting'.
                         (setting j 8 (1+ j))
                         (when (> j 12) (leaving))
                         j)))
                (collecting a)))
#+end_src

In ~loopy~, the =sub-loop= command is a full ~loopy~ loop ([[#sub-loops]]).  In
~loopy-iter~, it is a full ~loopy-iter~ loop.  If you do not want this, you can
specifically use a full ~loopy~ loop using the loop command ~loopy~ instead, as
in =(for loopy)= or just =loopy=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => (2 3 4 5)
  (loopy-iter outer
              (listing i '([1 2] [3 4]))
              ;; NOTE: `loopy-iter' style, not `loopy' style
              (sub-looping (arraying j i)
                           (at outer
                               (let ((val (1+ j)))
                                 (collecting val)))))

  ;; => (2 3 4 5)
  (loopy-iter outer
              (listing i '([1 2] [3 4]))
              ;; NOTE: `loopy' style, not `loopy-iter' style
              (loopy (array j i)
                     (set val (1+ j))
                     (at outer (collect val))))
#+end_src

Finally, there are a few things to keep in mind when using ~loopy-iter~:
1. ~loopy~ (and so ~loopy-iter~) does not currently have all of the features of
   Common Lisp's ~iterate~ macro.  Think of it more as an alternative form of
   ~loopy~ instead of a port of ~iterate~.
2. You should not rely on the value of a loop command's expanded code.  Such
   expansion is an implementation detail and subject to change.
3. Some macros, especially those that interact with each other, produce broken
   code while ~loopy-iter~ is expanding its arguments.  For example,
   ~cl-return-from~ is known to be problematic, since it tries to interact with
   the correct ~cl-block~.

   Macros that should not be expanded while ~loopy-iter~ expands are listed in
   ~loopy-iter-suppressed-macros~.  Note that this suppression is only in effect
   while ~loopy-iter~ expands its loop commands.  Once ~loopy-iter~ outputs its
   code, Emacs will attempt to further expand any macros in the outputted code.

   Ideally, such problematic macros are infrequent.  Please report such cases on
   this project's [[https://github.com/okamsn/loopy/issues][issues tracker]] so that they can be added to
   ~loopy-iter-suppressed-macros~ by default.

* Using Flags
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: flags
  :DESCRIPTION: Using flags to change behavior.
  :END:

  #+cindex: flag
  A "flag" is a symbol passed to the =flag= or =flags= special macro argument,
  changing the macro's behavior.  Currently, flags affect what method ~loopy~
  uses to perform destructuring (=pcase=, =seq=, =dash=, or the default) and
  whether accumulation commands that don't specify a variable (such as =(collect
  collect-value)=) accumulate into one or several variables.

  Flags are applied in order.  If you specify =(flags seq pcase)=, then ~loopy~
  will use ~pcase-let~ for destructuring, not ~seq-let~.

  #+vindex: loopy-default-flags
  If you wish to always use a flag, you can add that flag to the list
  ~loopy-default-flags~.  These can be overridden by any flag given in the
  =flag= special macro argument.

  The following flags are currently supported:

  #+cindex: pcase flag
  - =pcase= :: Use ~pcase-let~ for destructuring
    ([[info:elisp#Destructuring with pcase Patterns]]).
  #+cindex: seq flag
  - =seq= :: Use ~seq-let~ for destructuring ([[info:elisp#seq-let]]).
  #+cindex: dash flag
  - =dash= :: Use the style of destructuring found in the =dash= library
   ([[info:dash#-let]]).
  #+cindex: split flag
  - =split= :: Make accumulation commands with implicit variables accumulate into
    separate variables, which are then collected into ~loopy-result~.
  #+cindex: default flag
  - =default= :: Use the default behavior for all options.


  For convenience, all flags (except =default=) can be undone by prefixing them
  with =-= (a dash or minus sign), which reverts ~loopy~ to its default
  behavior.

  For example, if you have set ~loopy-default-flags~ to =(dash split)= and wish
  to only use the =split= flag for a loop, you can use either =(flags default
  split)= or, more simply, =(flag -dash)=.  These prefixed flags only apply when
  the unprefixed version is active.  That is, =(flags pcase -dash)= is the same
  as just =(flags pcase)=, regardless of the value of ~loopy-default-flags~, as
  =pcase= destructuring will override all uses of =dash= destructuring as it
  comes later in the list.  Similarly, =(flags -dash dash)= and =(flags -dash
  +dash)= leave =dash= destructuring enabled, and =(flags +dash -dash)= disables
  =dash= destructuring and uses the default behavior.

  #+cindex: loopy-dash
  #+cindex: loopy-pcase
  #+cindex: loopy-seq
  The destructuring flags (=pcase=, =seq=, and =dash=) are separate libraries
  (respectively, =loopy-pcase=, =loopy-seq=, and =loopy-dash=) that must be
  loaded after =loopy=.  Currently, =loopy-dash= is a separate package.

  Below are some example of using the destructuring flags.  These flags affect
  the destructuring of:
  - iteration variables
  - accumulation variables
  - variables bound by the special macro argument =with=

  #+attr_texinfo: :tag Note
  #+begin_quote
  These flags do not affect the destructuring of generalized variables
  (~setf~-able places) as the libraries =pcase.el=, =seq.el=, and =dash.el= do
  not yet provide the required functionality.
  #+end_quote

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

           (finally-return (+ sum1 v1) (+ sum2 v2)))
  #+end_src

  As noted in previous sections, the =split= flag can be used to generate more
  efficient code for accumulation commands ([[#accumulation-commands]]).  By making
  stronger guarantees about how accumulation variables can be used, ~loopy~ can
  produce results fasters.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Both of these example give the same result, but the latter

            (finally-return i j k))

     ;; => ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
     (loopy (flag split) ; Don't accumulate into same implicit variable.

            (collect i)
            (collect j)

* Custom Aliases
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: custom-aliases
:DESCRIPTION: How to add one's own aliases.
:END:

#+cindex: custom aliases
An {{{dfn(alias)}}} is another name for a command or special macro argument.
~loopy~ comes with several built-in aliases, such as =string= for the command
=array= or =else= for the special macro argument =after-do=.

| Command or Special Macro Argument | Built-In Aliases           |
|-----------------------------------+----------------------------|
| =array=                           | =string=                   |
| =seq-ref=                         | =sequence-ref=, =seqf=     |
| =after-do=                        | =after=, =else=, =else-do= |


An alias works the same as the original command or special macro argument.
They are provided for clarity and convenience.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; => ("a" "b" "c" "d")
  (loopy (array i "abcd")
         (collect (char-to-string i)))

  ;; => ("a" "b" "c" "d")
  (loopy (string i "abcd")
         (collect (char-to-string i)))
#+end_src


#+findex: loopy-defalias
Users can define custom aliases using the macro ~loopy-defalias~, which takes an
alias and a definition as arguments.  These arguments can be quoted or
unquoted.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (loopy-defalias items array)

  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy (items i [1 2 3])
         (collect i))
#+end_src

The definition must exist for the alias to be defined correctly.  Definitions
can themselves be aliases, so long as they are already defined.  In other words,
when aliasing custom commands, you should define the alias /after/ defining the
command ([[#adding-custom-commands]]).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Define an alias for the `items' alias from above:
  (loopy-defalias items2 items)

  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy (items2 i [1 2 3])
         (collect i))
#+end_src

When looking for how to parse a command, ~loopy~ will check aliases before
checking the true names of commands.  Effectively, this means that commands can
be overridden by aliases, though this is discouraged.  Such commands can still
be accessed via their other names.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Define `cons' as an alias of `array':
  (loopy-defalias cons array)

  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (loopy (cons i [1 2 3])
         (collect i))

  ;; ERROR: Can no longer use the original definition:
  (loopy (cons i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i))

  ;; Other names still work:
  ;; => ((1 2 3) (2 3) (3))
  (loopy (conses i '(1 2 3))
         (collect i))
#+end_src


Special macro arguments ([[#macro-arguments][Special Macro Arguments]]) can also be aliased.  Using
an alias does not change the fact that the special macro arguments are parsed
before loop commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (loopy-defalias as with)

  ;; => (8 9 10)
  (loopy (as (a 7))
         (list i '(1 2 3))
         (collect (+ i 7)))
#+end_src


#+vindex: loopy-aliases
The macro ~loopy-defalias~ modifies the user option ~loopy-aliases~.  However,
while ~loopy~ is still changing, it is recommended to avoid modifying this
variable directly, as its structure may change in the future.  ~loopy-defalias~
is the forward-compatible way of creating aliases.


* Custom Commands
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: adding-custom-commands
  :DESCRIPTION: Extending `loopy' with personal commands.
  :END:

  This section contains information about how loop commands work and how one can
  add custom commands to ~loopy~.  Two examples are provided.

** Background Info
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background-info
   :DESCRIPTION: The internals of `loopy'.
   :END:

   #+cindex: instruction, instructions
   The core working of ~loopy~ is taking a loop command and generating code that
   becomes part of a ~while~-loop.  This code is represented by
   {{{dfn(instructions)}}}, which basically describe where and how code is
   inserted into/around a template of a ~while~-loop.

   Some examples of instructions are:
   - Declaring a given variable in a ~let~-like form to make sure it's locally
     scoped.
   - Declaring a generated variable in a ~let~-like form to contain a given
     value.
   - Adding a condition for continuing/exiting the loop.
   - Adding code to be run during the main processing section of the
     ~while~-loop.  This location is referred to as the {{{dfn(main body)}}} of
     the loop.
   - Adding code to be run after the main processing section, such as for
     updating variables.  This location is referred to as the
     {{{dfn(latter body)}}} of the loop.

   For example, parsing the command =(list i '(1 2 3))= produces the following
   list of instructions.  Some commands require the creation of unique temporary
   variables, such as =list-211= in the below output.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ((loopy--iteration-vars (list-211 '(1 2 3)))
      (loopy--iteration-vars (i nil))
      (loopy--pre-conditions (consp list-211))
      (loopy--main-body      (setq i (car list-211)))
      (loopy--latter-body    (setq list-211 (cdr list-211))))
   #+END_SRC

   The first element of an instruction describes where to insert code into the
   template.  The second element of an instruction is the inserted code.  You
   can see that not all of the code to be inserted is a valid Lisp form.  For
   example, the above instruction referencing ~loopy--iteration-vars~ inserts a
   binding for the variable =list-211= into a ~let~-like form.

   | Place                   | Code                             |
   |-------------------------+----------------------------------|
   | =loopy--iteration-vars= | =(list-211 '(1 2 3))=            |
   | =loopy--latter-body=    | =(setq list-211 (cdr list-211))= |
   | =loopy--pre-conditions= | =(consp list-211)=               |
   | =loopy--iteration-vars= | =(i nil)=                        |
   | =loopy--main-body=      | =(setq i (car list-211)))=       |

   Commands are parsed by ~loopy--parse-loop-command~, which receives a command
   call, such as =(list i '(1 2 3))=, and returns a list of instructions.  It
   does this by searching for an appropriate command-specific parsing function
   in ~loopy-aliases~ and ultimately in ~loopy-command-parsers~.  For
   parsing multiple commands in order, there is ~loopy--parse-loop-commands~,
   which wraps the single-command version.

   For example, consider the function ~loopy--parse-if-command~, which parses
   the =if= loop command.  It needs to check the instructions of the
   sub-commands passed to =if=, looking for code that would be inserted into the
   main loop body (as determined by the first element of the instruction).  Once
   found, it wraps that code with an ~if~-form.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => ((loopy--iteration-vars (i nil))
     ;;     (loopy--main-body (setq i 1)))
     (loopy--parse-loop-command '(set i 1))

     ;; => ((loopy--iteration-vars (i nil))
     ;;     (loopy--main-body (if (my-condition)
     ;;                           (setq i 1)
     ;;                         (setq i 2))))
     (loopy--parse-if-command '(if (my-condition)
                                   (set i 1)
                                 (set i 2)))
   #+end_src

   For the purpose of this example, below is a version of the parsing function
   made of the basic Lisp features with which you are familiar.  The actual
   definition makes use of more convenient Emacs Lisp libraries and can be seen
   in the library {{{file(loopy-commands.el)}}}.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'loopy-commands)
     (defun loopy--parse-if-command (arg)

             (if-true   (caddr arg))  ; Third element of `arg'.
             (if-false  (cdddr arg))) ; Remaining elements of `arg'.

         ;; The main processing of this function is to separate instructions
         ;; for the loop's main body from other instructions,
         ;; and to then wrap those main-body instructions with an

   The hardest part of this exchange is making sure that the inserted code ends
   up in the correct order.

   A loop command has 7 main places to put code:

   #+vindex: loopy--generalized-vars
   - =loopy--generalized-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and a macro
     expansion that will be given to =cl-symbol-macrolet=.  This is used to
     create named ~setf~-able places.  The expansion you use depends on the kind
     of sequence and how the it is updated.

     For example, =(list-ref i my-list)= declares =i= to be a symbol which
     expands to =(car TEMP-VAR)=, in which =TEMP-VAR= holds the value of
     =my-list=.  At the end of the loop body, =TEMP-VAR= is set to its =cdr=,
     ensuring that the next call to =car= returns the correct value.

   #+vindex: loopy--iteration-vars
   - =loopy--iteration-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and an expression that will be
     given to ~let*~.  This is used for initializing variables needed for
     iteration commands, such as the =i= in =(list i '(1 2 3))= or to store the
     list ='(1 2 3)= in =(list i '(1 2 3))=.  This also includes variables
     needed for destructuring.

   #+vindex: loopy--accumulation-vars
   - =loopy--accumulation-vars= :: Lists of a symbol and an expression that will
     be given to ~let*~.  This is used for initializing variables needed for
     accumulation commands, such as the =coll= in =(collect coll my-val)= or any
     variables needed for destructuring.

   #+vindex: loopy--pre-conditions
   - =loopy--pre-conditions= :: Expressions that determine if the =while=
     loop runs/continues, such as whether a list still has elements in it.
     If there is more than one expression, than all expressions are used in
     an =and= special form.

   #+vindex: loopy--main-body
   - =loopy--main-body= :: Expressions that make up the main body of the
     loop.

   #+vindex: loopy--latter-body
   - =loopy--latter-body= :: Expressions that need to be run after the main
     body, such as updating some of variables that determine when a loop ends.

   #+vindex: loopy--post-conditions
   - =loopy--post-conditions= :: Expressions that determine whether the
     =while= loop continues, but checked after the loop body has run.  The
     code from this is ultimately appended to the latter body before being
     substituted in.

   For accumulation commands, you might also wish to place values in the
   following:

   #+vindex: loopy--implicit-return
   - =loopy--implicit-return= :: A list of values to be returned by the loop if
     no other return value is specified/reached. A value is added to this list
     when an accumulation command does not specify an accumulation variable, and
     in some special other cases.

     By default, the implicit return value is ~loopy-result~, and so this
     variable is usually just a list of the symbol =loopy-result=.  When the
     =split= flag is enabled, this is a list of values to which ~loopy-result~
     is bound.

   #+vindex: loopy--accumulation-final-updates
   - =loopy--accumulation-final-updates= :: Actions to perform on the
     accumulation variable after the loop ends.  Some implied accumulation
     commands need to update the variable one final time after ending the loop.
     Some examples are:
     1. Correcting the order of elements in a list that was constructed in
        reverse.
     2. Coercing the variable into a new sequence type, for commands with the
        ~:result-type~ argument.

     Each accumulation variable can only be updated once, in a single way.  For
     example, a variable cannot be reversed according to the needs of one
     command and then coerced into a new type according to the needs of another.
     Commands acting on the same accumulation variable must require the same
     final update, if they require any final update.


   Loopy will attempt to produce efficient code, and will not attempt to set up
   features which are not used.  Therefore, the expanded code depends on the
   kinds of instructions that are returned by the parsing functions.  For the
   most part, the instructions affect the expansion of the loop that contains
   their respective command.  However, there are cases where a command must send
   instructions to a surrounding loop, not just the loop which immediately
   contains it.  Consider using an accumulation command within the =at= command,
   as in the below example.  The accumulation variable must be declared for the
   loop =outer=, but the accumulation itself must still occur within the loop
   =inner=.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; => (1 2 3 4)
     (loopy outer
            (array i [(1 2) (3 4)])
            (sub-loop inner
                      (list j i)
                      (at outer (collect coll j)))
            (finally-return coll))
   #+end_src

   To communicate these instructions, use ~loopy--at-instructions~.  For
   example, the output of parsing =(at outer (collect j :at start))= would be a
   list of instructions similar to those below.  While all of these
   sub-instructions are produced by parsing the =collect= command, not all are
   sent to the loop =outer=.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ((loopy--at-instructions
       (outer (loopy--accumulation-vars (loopy-result nil))
              (loopy--implicit-return loopy-result)))
      (loopy--main-body (setq loopy-result (cons j loopy-result))))
   #+end_src

   #+vindex: loopy--at-instructions
   - =loopy--at-instructions= :: Instructions that should be interpreted by a
     surrounding loop.  For example, this kind of instruction is used by the
     =at=, =skip-from=, and =leave-from= commands.  The instruction's value is a
     list of a loop name followed by sub-instructions.

     This variable works as a something like a combination of a stack and a map.
     This means that then when multiple surrounding loops share the same name,
     the instructions affect the innermost surrounding loop of that name.


   There are 4 more variables a loop command can push to, but they are derived
   from the macro's arguments.  Adding to them after using a macro argument
   might lead to unintended behavior.  You might wish to use them if, for
   example, you are concerned with what happens after the loop exits/completes.

   #+vindex: loopy--before-do
   - =loopy--before-do= :: Expressions to evaluate before the loop.  These are
     derived from the =before-do= macro argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--after-do
   - =loopy--after-do= :: Expressions to evaluate after the loop completes
     successfully.  These are derived from the =after-do= macro argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--final-do
   - =loopy--final-do= :: Expressions to evaluate after the loop completes,
     regardless of success.  These are derived from the =finally-do= macro
     argument.

   #+vindex: loopy--final-return
   - =loopy--final-return= :: An expression that is always returned by the
     macro, regardless of any early returns in the loop body.  This is
     derived from the =finally-return= macro argument.


   #+vindex: loopy--loop-name
   Some commands might depend on the name of the loop.  The symbol which names
   the loop is stored in the variable ~loopy--loop-name~.  The default name is
   ~nil~.

   The structure of the macro’s expanded code depends on the features used
   (e.g., ~loopy~ won’t try to declare variables if none exist), but the result
   will work similar to the below example.

** Hello World
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-small-example
   :DESCRIPTION: A minimal working example.
   :END:

   To implement a custom loop body command, =loopy= needs two pieces of
   information:
   1. The keyword that names your command
   2. The parsing function that can turn uses of your command into instructions.

   Importantly, your custom commands cannot share a name.

   For example, say that you're tired of typing out
   =(do (message "Hello, %s %s" PERSONAL-NAME FAMILY-NAME))= and would prefer
   to instead use =(greet PERSONAL-NAME [FAMILY-NAME])=.  This only requires
   adding code to the loop's main body, so the definition of the parsing
   function is quite simple.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'cl-lib)
     (cl-defun my-loopy-greet-command-parser
         ((_ personal-name &optional family-name))
       "Greet one with PERSONAL-NAME and optional FAMILY-NAME."
       `((loopy--main-body (if ,family-name
                               (message "Hello, %s %s"
                                        ,personal-name ,family-name)
                             (message "Hello, %s" ,personal-name)))))
   #+END_SRC

   =loopy= will pass the entire command expression to the parsing function, and
   expects back a list of instructions.

   #+vindex: loopy-command-parsers
   To tell =loopy= about this function, add it and the command name =greet= to
   the variable =loopy-command-parsers=, which associates commands with parsing
   functions.  The function that is paired with the symbol receives the entire
   command expression, and should produce a list of valid instructions.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; Using the Map library, for convenience.
     (require 'map)
     (setf (map-elt loopy-command-parsers 'greet)
           #'my-loopy-greet-command-parser)
   #+END_SRC

   After that, you can use your custom command in the loop body.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (loopy (list name '(("John" "Deer") ("Jane" "Doe") ("Jimmy")))
            (greet (car name) (cadr name)))
   #+END_SRC

   By running {{{kbd(M-x pp-macroexpand-last-sexp RET)}}} on the above
   expression, you can see that it expands to do what we want, as expected.  You
   might notice that one shortcoming of the current definition is that if a
   function is used to produce the second argument, as in ~(greet
   (personal-name) (family-name))~, then that function is called twice.  This
   occurs with ~(cadr name)~ in the below output, and can cause problems when
   using stateful functions.  This particular case can be resolved by using
   ~if-let~ to first store the result of ~(cadr name)~, and is something to keep
   in mind when defining Lisp macro expansions in general.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; An example expansion.
     (let* ((list-166 '(("John" "Deer") ("Jane" "Doe") ("Jimmy")))
            (name nil))
       (cl-block nil
         (while (consp list-166)
           (setq name (car list-166))
           (if (cadr name)
               (message "Hello, %s %s"
                        (car name)
                        (cadr name))
             (message "Hello, %s"
                      (car name)))
           (setq list-166 (cdr list-166)))
         nil))
   #+END_SRC

** An ~always~ Command
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: always-example
   :DESCRIPTION: Adding a feature from `cl-loop'.
   :END:

   Lets say we want to emulate ~cl-loop~'s =always= clause, which causes the
   loop to return ~nil~ if an expression evaluates to ~nil~ and ~t~ otherwise.
   This is similar to the functions ~cl-every~ and ~seq-every-p~.

   Here is an example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; => t
     (cl-loop for i from 1 to 9 always (< i 10))
   #+END_SRC

   While ~loopy~ already has an =always= command, we'll ignore it for the sake
   of this example.  Without a custom command, you could translate this using
   the following code:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; => t
     (loopy (nums i 1 9)
            (unless (< i 10) (return nil))
            (else-do (cl-return t)))
   #+END_SRC

   This is similar to what you might write in other languages, such as Python.

   #+begin_src python
     # In some testing Python function:
     for i in range(1, 10):
         if not (i < 10):
             return False
     else:
         return True
   #+end_src

   While the meaning of the code is clear, this approach is certainly wordier.

   Here's how one could do this using a custom command.  Again, =loopy= already
   comes with a built-in =always= command.  This example is taken directly from
   the file {{{file(loopy-commands.el)}}}, which contains the code of all of
   ~loopy~'s built-in parsers.

   We can describe the command's desired behavior in two sentences:
   1. The loop should immediately return ~nil~ if the expression ever evaluates
      to ~nil~.
   2. The loop should return ~t~ if the loop is able to complete successfully.

   This simplest way to satisfy the first requirement is to conditionally use
   ~cl-return~ if the expressions ever evaluates to ~nil~.  We want to do this
   while the loop is running, so we should use an instruction for
   ~loopy--main-body~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; We want to insert the below code into the loop
     (unless CONDITION
       (cl-return nil))

     ;; so we use the instruction
     `(loopy--main-body (unless ,CONDITION (cl-return nil)))

     ;; where CONDITION is supplied by the parsing function.
   #+end_src

   For a simple loop, this works well enough.  However, the function ~cl-return~
   only works with blocks that are named ~nil~.  If we have named the loop, then
   ~cl-return~ won't work, and might instead cause unexpected errors.
   Therefore, it is better to use ~cl-return-from~ with the variable
   ~loopy--loop-name~.  As noted in the previous section, ~loopy--loop-name~
   stores the symbol which names the loop.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     `(loopy--main-body (unless ,CONDITION
                          (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name nil)))
   #+end_src

   The best way to satisfy the second requirement is to use an instruction for
   ~loopy--implicit-return~.  One /could/ try to insert code using
   ~cl-return-from~ into ~loopy--after-do~, and this /would/ cause a value to be
   returned after the loop had successfully completed, but doing it that way
   could unexpectedly prevent other code in =after-do= from running.  Using an
   implicit return value does not have that problem.

   This gives us the following instruction, which will add ~t~ to the list of
   values the macro returns if nothing else would be returned.  If that list is
   just ~'(t)~, then the macro knows to just return ~t~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     '(loopy--implicit-return t)
   #+end_src

   Once we've chosen our instructions, we need to tell =loopy= what function to
   use to produce these instructions.  Like in the previous example, we define
   the parsing function and add it to ~loopy-command-parsers~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; As noted in the previous section, the parsing function is always
     ;; passed the entire command as `(always CONDTION)', not just the
     ;; command arguments as `CONDITION'.

     (cl-defun my--loopy-always-command-parser ((_ condition))
       "Parse a command of the form `(always CONDITION)'.

     If any condition is nil, `loopy' should immediately return nil.
     Otherwise, `loopy' should return t."
       `((loopy--implicit-return t)
         (loopy--main-body (unless ,condition
                             (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name nil)))))

     (setf (map-elt loopy-command-parsers 'always)
           #'my--loopy-always-command-parser)
   #+end_src

   Once we've added our parsing function to ~loopy-command-parsers~,
   =loopy= will use that function whenever it tries to understand the =always=
   command.  In this case, this custom parser would supercede the built-in
   parser.

   With that done, our custom =always= command is as useful as the corresponding
   ~cl-loop~ clause.  However, because ~loopy~ uses expressions instead of
   keyword clauses like ~cl-loop~, we can do slightly better.  For convenience,
   we can easily allow passing multiple conditions to the command instead of
   just one.  In such cases, the conditions should be wrapped in an ~and~ form,
   and that is indeed what the built-in parser does.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; The built-in parser, taken from `loopy-commands.el':
     (cl-defun loopy--parse-always-command ((_ &rest conditions))
       "Parse a command of the form `(always [CONDITIONS])'.

     If any condition is nil, `loopy' should immediately return nil.
     Otherwise, `loopy' should return t."
       `((loopy--implicit-return t)
         ;; If there are multiple conditions, wrap these conditions in `and'.
         (loopy--main-body (unless ,(if (= 1 (length conditions))
                                        (cl-first conditions)
                                      `(and ,@conditions))
                             (cl-return-from ,loopy--loop-name nil)))))
   #+end_src

   Here are some examples of the command in action:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; One condition: => t
     (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9)) (always (< i 10)))

     ;; Two conditions: => nil
     (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9))
            (list j '(2 4 6 8 9))
            (always (< i 10) (cl-evenp j)))

     ;; The previous example is equivalent to this.
     (loopy (list i (number-sequence 1 9))
            (list j '(2 4 6 8 9))
            (always (and (< i 10) (cl-evenp j))))
   #+end_src

** Custom commands in the ~loopy-iter~ macro
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: custom-commands-for-loopy-iter
:END:

See also [[#loopy-iter]].

~loopy-iter~ works by:
1. separating main-body instructions from other instructions
2. expanding that main-body code for ~loopy~ sub-commands
3. collected those expansions into the outputted loop's body
4. processing the collected non-main-body instructions

Most loop commands should work with ~loopy-iter~ without any changes.  Some loop
commands are just ~loopy~ versions of built-in Lisp macros or special forms, and
so aren't needed in ~loopy-iter~ in the first place.

However, special consideration is needed for commands that produce main-body
code outside of main-body instructions, or that assume all of their arguments
are loop commands.  Consider the parser for the =at= command:

All it does is process its arguments and wrap the resulting instructions in an
=at= instruction.  By wrapping main-body instructions in an =at= instruction,
~loopy-iter~ does not see the main-body code, and so cannot use it.  Instead, an
alternative parser must be use:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (cl-defun loopy-iter--parse-at-command ((_ target-loop &rest commands))
  "Parse the `at' command as (at &rest COMMANDS).

  ;; We need to capture all non-main-body instructions into a new `at'
  ;; instruction, so we just temporarily `let'-bind
  ;; `loopy-iter--non-main-body-instructions' while expanders push to it,

  ;; function, which consumes instructions.

#+vindex: loopy-iter--non-main-body-instructions
This ~loopy-iter~-specific definition separates the main-body instructions out
from the other instructions so that ~loopy-iter~ can operate on their values
directly.  The variable ~loopy-iter--non-main-body-instructions~ is a place
where the macro-expanding parsers used by ~loopy-iter~ can push lists of
instructions (see the code for usage examples).

   :END:

   If you would like to see more examples, consider reading through the source

   built-in loop commands.  You can easily find this file using
   {{{kbd(M-x find-library loopy-commands RET)}}}.

* Comparing to ~cl-loop~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: comparing-to-cl-loop
:DESCRIPTION: Why `loopy' instead of `cl-loop'.
:END:

~loopy~ should be comparable with ~cl-loop~ for most things, keeping in mind the
following:
- ~loopy~ should be as fast or faster than ~cl-loop~, though some optimizations
  are more explicit.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Compare efficiency of accumulations using
    ;; M-x pp-macroexpand-last-sexp:
    (cl-loop for i in (number-sequence 1 10)
             if (cl-evenp i) collect i into evens
             else collect i into odds
             finally return (list odds evens))

    (loopy (accum-opt odds evens)
           (list i (number-sequence 1 10))
           (if (cl-evenp i)
               (collect evens i)
             (collect odds i))
           (finally-return odds evens))
  #+end_src

- Loop commands are always evaluated in order.

- ~loopy~ has a more flexible set of looping features:
  - Several accumulation commands can accumulate onto the beginning or end of
    the resulting sequence, as in Common Lisp's Iterate.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; => (3 2 1 8 9 10)
      (loopy (array i [1 2 3])
             (collect i :at start)
             (collect (+ i 7) :at end))
    #+end_src

  - It has more flexible control-flow commands, under which you can easily group
    sub-commands, including assignments.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; => ((2 4)
      ;;     ((1 8) (2 9)))
      (loopy (list i '(1 2 3 4))
             (if (cl-evenp i)
                 (collect evens i)
               (set var1 (1+ var1) :init 0)
               (set var2 (+ 7 var1))
               (collect vars (list var1 var2)))
             (finally-return evens vars))((2 4) )
    #+end_src

  - It has a =skip= command to skip the rest of the loop body and immediately
    start the next iteration.  Of course, a similar effect could be achieved
    using the =when= or =unless= commands.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; => (1 3)
      (loopy (list i '(1 2 3))
             (when (= i 2) (skip))
             (collect i))
    #+end_src

- ~loopy~ has more featureful destructuring, which is supported by both
  iteration and accumulation commands.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; => ((1 4) (2 6) (3 5))
    (loopy (array (&whole elem _ &rest rest) [(1 :a 2 :b 3)
                                              (4 :b 5 :a 6)])
           (collect (first) elem)
           (collect (&key a b) rest)
           (finally-return first a b))
  #+end_src

  - Such destructuring is configurable.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; => ((1 3) (2 4))
      (loopy (flag pcase)
             (array elem [(1 2) (3 4)])
             (collect `(,a ,b) elem)
             (finally-return a b))
    #+end_src

- The macro is extensible.


~loopy~ is not always a one-to-one replacement for ~cl-loop~, but it is easy
to use and extend, and performs well in the cases that it already handles.

Below is a simple example of ~loopy~ vs ~cl-loop~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'cl-lib)
  (cl-loop with some-thing = 5
           for i from 1 to 100
           do (message "I is %s" i)
           when (> (+ i 5) 20)
           return (format "Done: %d" i))

  (require 'loopy)
  (loopy (with (some-thing 5))
         (nums i 1 100)
         (do (message "I is %s" i))
         (when (> (+ i 5) 20)
           (return (format "Done: %d" i))))
#+END_SRC

The main benefit (I believe) of Loopy is clearer grouping of commands under
conditionals while still using a clean syntax, such as in the below example.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; => '((2 4) (4 8) (6 12) (8 16) (10 20))
  (loopy (nums i 1 10)
         (when (cl-evenp i)
           (set once i)
           (set twice (* 2 i))
           (collect doubles (list once twice)))
         (finally-return doubles))
#+END_SRC

In my experience, ~cl-loop~ does not allow the easy grouping of assignment
statements under a =when= condition.  For example, below is something I would
like to try to do with ~cl-loop~.

I am aware that in this example the =for= statements aren't necessary and that
the =collect= statements would be sufficient, but (when I come across things
like this in my work) I would like to use them to declare variables for
readability purposes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'cl-lib)
  (save-match-data
    (cl-loop with pattern = "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)"
             for line in (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2")
             when (string-match pattern line)
             for line-num = (concat "L" (match-string 1 line))
             and for data-num = (concat "D" (match-string 2 line))

             ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

             and collect line-num into line-nums
             and collect data-num into data-nums
             finally return (list line-nums data-nums)))

  ;; Normal Elisp:
  (save-match-data
    (let ((pattern "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)")
          (line-nums)
          (data-nums))
      (dolist (line (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2"))
        (when (string-match pattern line)
          (let ((line-num (concat "L" (match-string 1 line)))
                (datum-num (concat "D" (match-string 2 line))))

            ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

            (push line-num line-nums)
            (push datum-num data-nums))))
      (list (nreverse line-nums) (nreverse data-nums))))
#+END_SRC

Here is how one could currently do it with ~loopy~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'loopy)
  (save-match-data
    (loopy (with (pattern "^Line\\([[:digit:]]\\)-Data\\([[:digit:]]\\)"))
           (list line (split-string "Line1-Data1\nBad\nLine2-Data2"))
           (when (string-match pattern line)
             (set line-num (concat "L" (match-string 1 line)))
             (set datum-num (concat "D" (match-string 2 line)))

             ;; … Further processing now that data is named …

             (collect line-nums line-num)
             (collect data-nums datum-num))
           (finally-return line-nums data-nums)))
#+END_SRC

I believe that the value of the macro increases for longer loop bodies with
several conditional commands.

Another nice ability, one that I'm not sure ~cl-loop~ has, is a specific
command for skipping/continuing a loop iteration.  Of course, one could also
re-organize code under a conditional command like =when= to achieve the same
effect.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Returns even numbers that aren't multiples of 10.
  ;;
  ;; => (2 4 6 8 12 14 16 18)
  (loopy (nums i 1 20)
         (when (zerop (mod i 10))
           (skip))
         (when (cl-evenp i)
           (collect i)))
#+END_SRC

* Translating to and from =cl-loop=
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: translating-from-cl-loop
  :DESCRIPTION: Converting `cl-loop' to `loopy', and vice versa.
  :END:

  ~loopy~ and ~cl-loop~ use slightly different terminology.  The equivalent of
  "for clauses" are referred to as "iteration commands" in ~loopy~, as they
  generally are used for iterating through sequences.  Meanwhile, "iteration
  clauses" can be separated into "iteration commands" (=repeat= and =iter-by=
  (not yet implemented)) and "early-exit commands" (=while= and =until=).

  "Accumulation clauses" work the same as "accumulation commands".

** For Clauses
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: for-clauses
   :END:

   As Emacs has many functions that return lists, there is no need to implement
   an exact equivalent for every =for=-clause that ~cl-loop~ has.  Instead, one
   can just iterate through the return value of the appropriate function using
   the =list= command.

   For the commands operating on hash tables, see also the generic iteration
   command =map-pairs=, which works generically on hash tables, association
   lists ("alists"), property lists ("plists"), and vectors.

*  Real-World Examples
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Extra example of how one could use `loopy'.
  :END:

  This section contains examples of loops that exist in real-world commands.  To
  see these loops in context, full examples of those commands can be found
  online in the file {{{file(examples/loopy-examples.el)}}} in this package's
  repository [fn:repo].

  One command that could see a benefit from using =loopy= is =selectrum-swiper=
  from the Selectrum wiki [fn:sel-wiki].  This command allows a user to jump to
  a matched line in the buffer.  Candidates are created by looping through text
  lines, formatting non-empty lines and collecting the formatted lines into a
  list of candidates.  At the same time, it selects a default candidate by
  finding the non-empty line closest to the current line.

  Here is the main portion of the command, which uses ~cl-loop~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (cl-loop
     with buffer-lines = (split-string (buffer-string) "\n")
     with number-format = (concat "L%0"
                                  (number-to-string
                                   (length (number-to-string
                                            (length buffer-lines))))
                                  "d: ")

     with formatted-candidates = nil
     for line-text in buffer-lines
     for line-num = (line-number-at-pos (point-min) t) then (1+ line-num)

     with default-candidate = nil
     with prev-distance-to-default-cand = 1.0e+INF ; This updated later.
     for distance-to-default-cand = (abs (- current-line-number line-num))

     unless (string-empty-p line-text)      ; Just skip empty lines.
     do
     ;; Find if we’ve started to move away from the current line.
     (when (null default-candidate)
       (when (> distance-to-default-cand
                prev-distance-to-default-cand)
         (setq default-candidate (cl-first formatted-candidates)))
       (setq prev-distance-to-default-cand distance-to-default-cand))

     ;; Format current line and collect candidate.
     (push (propertize line-text
                       'selectrum-candidate-display-prefix
                       (propertize (format number-format line-num)
                                   'face 'completions-annotations)
                       'line-num line-num)
           formatted-candidates)

     finally return (list default-candidate
                          (nreverse formatted-candidates)))
    ;; ...
  #+end_src

  The limitations of ~cl-loop~'s =when= clause encourages relying on Lisp
  expressions rather than clauses for processing.  To use those Lisp
  expressions, one must declare more variables with the =with= clause to ensure
  that those variables are locally scoped.

  Here is how it could be done with =loopy=:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (loopy
     (with (buffer-text-lines (split-string (buffer-string) "\n"))
           (number-format (concat "L%0"
                                  (number-to-string

  We can see that most of the loop commands are easily grouped under the
  =unless= command.  This allows for less noise, as we do not need to declare
  variables or fall back to using more Lisp expressions.

  Another good example is the command =selectrum-outline= from the same page.
  This command is similar to =selectrum-swiper=, but has a slightly more
  complicated processing portion.

  The code loops through each line in the buffer, searching for lines that match
  a pre-determined regular expression.  The match data is used to determine the
  heading level (top level, second level, etc.) and the actual heading text.
  The loop produces formatted candidates by prepending this heading text with
  the text of parent headings, as determined by the heading level.  At the same
  time, the loop selects the current heading as the default candidate.

  Instead of using ~cl-loop~, this command is written in conventional Emacs
  Lisp.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ...
    (let (;; Get the basic information of each heading in the accessible
          ;; portion of the buffer.

  In my opinion, the =loopy= version is a bit cleaner.  Even when following the
  same flow of logic, you still get the benefit of less typing with no loss in
  clarity.

  If one were writing code like this often (say, in a library), then the loop
  body could be simplified even further with custom commands
  ([[#adding-custom-commands]]).
