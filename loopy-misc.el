;;; Commentary:
;; `loopy' is a macro that is used similarly to `cl-loop'.  It provides "loop
;; commands" that define a loop body and it's surrounding environment, as well
;; as exit conditions.
;;
;; This library provides features used by several of the libraries that form
;; the package `loopy'.  This separation exists for better organization.

;;; Code:

;; NOTE: This file can't require any of the other `loopy' files.
