;;; Commentary:
;; `loopy' is a macro that is used similarly to `cl-loop'.  It provides "loop
;; commands" that define a loop body and it's surrounding environment, as well
;; as exit conditions.
;;
;; This package provides the "loop commands" used in the `loop' macro argument
;; of the `loopy' macro, as well as functions and variables for working with
;; those commands.
;;
;; For convenience, the functions related to destructuring in accumulation
;; commands are also included in this library, as those are specific to the
;; accumulation commands.
;;
;; For more information, see this package's Info documentation under Info node
;; `(loopy)'.

;;; Code:

;; NOTE:
;;
;; For more easily finding loop commands using Imenu, you might wish to do
;; something like the below, which should work for most definitions.

;;;;; Iteration
(cl-defmacro loopy--defiteration
    (name doc-string &key keywords (required-vals 1) other-vals instructions)
  "Define an interation command parser for NAME.

An iteration command made with this macro has the layout of
\(command-name variable-name value [values] [keys]).  That is,
each command will always require a variable name and a value.
Some commands will have additional non-keyword arguments, which
will be either required or optional.  Some commands will have
keyword arguments, which, as in functions, are always optional.

Not all iteration loop commands are written using this macro.
This macro is for iteration commands that have the above
structure.

- NAME is the primary name of the loop command.  This creates a
  parsing function \"loopy--parse-NAME-command\".

- DOC-STRING is the documentation string for the produced parsing
  function.  It should describe the arguments of the loop command.

- KEYWORDS is an unquoted list of colon-prefixed keywords used by
  the command.

- REQUIRED-VALS is the number of required values.  For most
  iteration commands, this is one.  This can be one nil (or
  zero), a non-zero number, or an unquoted list of variable
  names.

  If a list of variable names, those names are used in the
  function definition.  Otherwise, the variables are named
  following the naming scheme \"valNUM\".

- OTHER-VALS is whether the command can take other arguments that
  are not keyword arguments.  This is one of nil, t, or an
  unquoted list of numbers.

  If a list of numbers, then those numbers describe the valid
  amounts of additional (non-keyword) arguments of the command.
  For example, (0 1) means that command has 1 optional
  non-keyword argument.  (1 3) means the command requires either
  1 or 3 additional non-keyword arguments.

  This means that if a command has no required arguments, but
  several optional non-keyword arguments, you can set
  REQUIRED-VALS to 0 and OTHER-VALS to a list of 0 and some
  integer.

  If t, no check if performed and the command takes any number of
  optional additional arguments.

- INSTRUCTIONS are the command's instructions.  This should be a
  single expression, such as a list of instructions or an
  expression capable of producing said instructions.

In the expanded parsing function, there are several values
automatically bound to variables, which can be used in
instructions:

- `name' is the name of the command.

- `cmd' is the entire command expression.

- `var' is the variable to be used by the command.

- `val' is the required value (generally, the sequence over which
  to iterate). If there are multiple required values, they are
  instead named according to the value of REQUIRED-VALS.

- `args' is a list of the remaining arguments of the command
   after `var' and `val'.  If either OTHER-VALS or KEYWORDS are
   nil, then this variable is not bound.  In that case, use the
   below two variables.

- `other-vals' is a list of additional values found in `args',
   if OTHER-VALS is non-nil.

- `opts' is a list of keyword arguments and their values,
  found in `args' after the elements of `other-vals'.
  It is assumed that this list can be treated as a property list.
  The first keyword in `args' determines the start of
  the optional keyword arguments.

  If OTHER-VALS is non-nil (i.e., no other values are allowed),
  then these keyword variables should be referenced directly
  instead of through the property list `opts'."

- KEYWORDS is the optional key-word parameters.  This macro does

accumulate values.  This is more similar to the syntax of
`cl-loop' and less like the convention of listing the variable
first.  This `:into' keyword need not be counted in the above
KEYWORDS.

There are several values automatically bound to variables, which
you can use in the instructions:

- `name' is the name of the command.
- `cmd' is the entire command.
- `args' is the arguments of the command that are not optional
  (except for the variable name).  These are the arguments before
  any keyword arguments.
- `var' is the variable to be used by the command.  This can be
  explicitly given, `loopy-result', or automatically generated.
