;;; Commentary:
;; A macro similar to, and heavily inspired by, Common Lisp's Iterate package.
;; This package is somewhat like a translation of Iter into Loopy.
;;
;; See the info node `(loopy)The loopy-iter Macro'.

;;; Code:
(eval-when-compile (require 'loopy))
(require 'loopy)
(require 'loopy-vars)
(require 'loopy-misc)
(require 'loopy-commands)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'seq)
(require 'map)
(require 'macroexp)
(require 'subr-x)

;; How the Code Works:
;;
;; Instead of parsing commands using `loopy--parse-loop-command', we use
;; `loopy-iter--parse-command' with commands being expanded like a normal Lisp
;; macro.  The code in the value of main-body instructions is taken and further
;; expanded, while non-main-body instructions are stored and eventually
;; processed after processing all of the macro arguments.
;;
;; Previously, `loopy-iter' used its tree-walking functions, as done by CL's
;; Iterate, but now it just defers to what Emacs already does when expanding
;; macros, such as in `macroexpand-all'.
