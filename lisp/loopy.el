;;; Commentary:
;; The `loopy' macro is used to generate code for a loop, similar to `cl-loop'.
;; Unlike `cl-loop', `loopy' uses symbolic expressions instead of "clauses".
;;
;; A simple usage of `cl-loop':
;;
;;     (cl-loop for i from 1 to 10
;;              if (cl-evenp i) collect i into evens
;;              else collect i into odds
;;              end ; This `end' keyword is optional here.
;;              finally return (list odds evens))
;;
;; How it could be done using `loopy':
;;
;;     (loopy (numbers i 1 10)
;;            (if (cl-evenp i)
;;                (collect evens i)
;;              (collect odds i))
;;            (finally-return odds evens))
;;
;; `loopy' supports destructuring for iteration commands like `list' and
;; accumulation commands like `sum' or `collect'.
;;
;;     ;; Summing the nth elements of arrays:
;;     ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
;;     (loopy (list (list-elem1 list-elem2)
;;                  '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
;;                    ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
;;            (sum [sum1 sum2 sum3] list-elem1)
;;            (sum [sum4 sum5 sum6] list-elem2)
;;            (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3 sum4 sum5 sum6))
;;
;;     ;; Or, more simply:
;;     ;; => (8 10 12 14 16 18)
;;     (loopy (list list-elem '(([1 2 3] [4 5 6])
;;                              ([7 8 9] [10 11 12])))
;;            (sum ([sum1 sum2 sum3] [sum4 sum5 sum6])
;;                 list-elem)
;;            (finally-return sum1 sum2 sum3 sum4 sum5 sum6))
;;
;;     ;; Separate the elements of sub-list:
;;     ;; => ((1 3) (2 4))
;;     (loopy (list i '((1 2) (3 4)))
;;            (collect (elem1 elem2) i)
;;            (finally-return elem1 elem2))
;;
;; The `loopy' macro is configurable and extensible.  In addition to writing
;; one's own "loop commands" (such as `list' in the example below), by using
;; "flags", one can choose whether to instead use `pcase-let', `seq-let', or
;; even the Dash library for destructuring.
;;
;;     ;; Use `pcase' to destructure array elements:
;;     ;; => ((1 2 3 4) (10 12 14) (11 13 15))
;;     (loopy (flag pcase)
;;            (array (or `(,car . ,cdr) digit)
;;                   [1 (10 . 11) 2 (12 . 13) 3 4 (14 . 15)])
;;            (if digit
;;                (collect digits digit)
;;              (collect cars car)
;;              (collect cdrs cdr))
;;            (finally-return digits cars cdrs))
;;
;;     ;; Using the default destructuring:
;;     ;; => ((1 2 3 4) (10 12 14) (11 13 15))
;;     (loopy (array elem [1 (10 . 11) 2 (12 . 13) 3 4 (14 . 15)])
;;            (if (numberp elem)
;;                (collect digits elem)
;;              (collect (cars . cdrs) elem))
;;            (finally-return digits cars cdrs))
;;
;; Variables like `cars', `cdrs', and `digits' in the example above are
;; automatically `let'-bound so as to not affect code outside of the loop.
;;
;; `loopy' has arguments for binding (or not binding) variables, executing code
;; before/after the loop, executing code only if the loop completes, and for
;; setting the macro's return value (default `nil').  This is in addition to the
;; looping features themselves.
;;
;; All of this makes `loopy' a useful and convenient choice for looping and
;; iteration.
;;
;; That being said, Loopy is not yet feature complete.  Please request features
;; or report problems in this projectâ€™s issues tracker
;; (<https://github.com/okamsn/loopy/issues>).  While most cases are covered,
;; full feature parity with some of the more niche uses of `cl-loop' is still
;; being worked on.
;;
;; For more information, including the full list of loop commands and how to
;; extend the macro, see this package's comprehensive Info documentation under
;; the Info node `(loopy)'.

;; (cl-defmacro loopy (&rest body)
;;   "A looping macro.
;;
;; The macro takes several top level arguments, all, except a loop
;; name, being a list beginning with one of the keywords below.  To
;; name a loop, pass in an unquoted symbol as an argument.
;;
;; - `with', `init', `let*': Declare variables before the loop.
;;
;; - `without', `no-with', `no-init': Variables that `loopy' should not try to
;;   initialize.  `loopy' tries to initialize all the variables it
;;   uses in a `let'-like form, but that isnâ€™t always desired.
;;
;; - `before-do', `before', `initially-do', `initially': Run Lisp
;;   expressions before the loop starts.
;;
;; - `after-do', `after', `else-do', `else': Run Lisp expressions
;;   after the loop successfully completes.  This is similar to
;;   Pythonâ€™s `else' loop clause.
;;
;; - `finally-do', `finally': Always run Lisp expressions after the
;;   loop exits.
;;
;; - `finally-return', `return': Return a value, regardless of how
;;   the loop completes.  Accumulation commands have an implicit
;;   return value, but this overrides them.
;;
;; - `flag', `flags': Options that change the behavior of `loopy'.
;;
;; The loop body and any expressions that are part of the
;; `before-do' and `after-do' arguments are contained in a single
;; `cl-block'.  Naming the loop really just names the block,
;; allowing for more specific exiting via ~cl-return~ and the loop
;; commands that wrap it.
;;
;; Finally, `(finally-return 1 2 3)' is the same as
;; `(finally-return (list 1 2 3))'.  This is convenient when using
;; `seq-let', `pcase-let', `cl-destructuring-bind', and the like.

This can be more flexible than using the `do' loop command in

  ;; 2) Set up the environments used for macro expansion.  These are alists of
  ;;    macro names and functions that process the macro arguments.  The
  ;;    functions only receive the arguments, not the name.
  ;;
  ;; 3) Parse commands and process the initial resulting instructions.  The
  ;;    result is a new body with the commands expanded, but the optimized
  ;;    accumulations incomplete and `at' instructions are not finished.
  ;;
  ;; 4) Parse the optimized accumulations and process the `at' instructions the
  ;;    resulted from processing the commands and instructions in Step 3.

  ;;    `macroexpand-progn').

(cl-defmacro loopy (&rest body)
  "A looping macro.

 The macro takes several top level arguments, all, except a loop
 name, being a list beginning with one of the keywords below.  To
 name a loop, pass in an unquoted symbol as an argument.

 - `with', `init', `let*': Declare variables before the loop.

 - `without', `no-with', `no-init': Variables that `loopy' should not try to
   initialize.  `loopy' tries to initialize all the variables it
   uses in a `let'-like form, but that isnâ€™t always desired.

 - `before-do', `before', `initially-do', `initially': Run Lisp
   expressions before the loop starts.

 - `after-do', `after', `else-do', `else': Run Lisp expressions
   after the loop successfully completes.  This is similar to
   Pythonâ€™s `else' loop clause.

 - `finally-do', `finally': Always run Lisp expressions after the
   loop exits.

 - `finally-return', `return': Return a value, regardless of how
   the loop completes.  Accumulation commands have an implicit
   return value, but this overrides them.

 - `flag', `flags': Options that change the behavior of `loopy'.

 The loop body and any expressions that are part of the
 `before-do' and `after-do' arguments are contained in a single
 `cl-block'.  Naming the loop really just names the block,
 allowing for more specific exiting via ~cl-return~ and the loop
 commands that wrap it.

 Finally, `(finally-return 1 2 3)' is the same as
 `(finally-return (list 1 2 3))'.  This is convenient when using
 `seq-let', `pcase-let', `cl-destructuring-bind', and the like.

 Any other argument in BODY is assumed to be a loop command.  For
 more information, including a list of available loop commands,
 see the Info node `(loopy)' distributed with this package."

(defmacro loopy-iter (&rest body)
  "Allows embedding loop commands in arbitrary code within this macro's body.

This can be more flexible than using the `do' loop command in
`loopy'.

Loop commands are expanded like macros inside the body.  Hence,
it's possible for the names of loop commands to overshadow other
definitions.  To avoid this, see the user options
`loopy-iter-bare-commands', `loopy-iter-bare-special-macro-arguments', and
`loopy-iter-keywords'.

See the Info node `(loopy)The loopy-iter Macro' for information
on how to use `loopy-iter'.  See the Info node `(loopy)' for how
to use `loopy' in general.
