;;; Commentary:
;; `loopy' is a macro that is used similarly to `cl-loop'.  It provides "loop
;; commands" that define a loop body and it's surrounding environment, as well
;; as exit conditions.
;;
;; For more information, see Loopy’s README.org or the Info files derived from
;; that README with the command `info'.
;;
;; This package provides extra functions to use Dash's destructuring abilities
;; in Emacs.

;;; Code:
(require 'loopy)
(require 'dash)
(require 'cl-lib)
