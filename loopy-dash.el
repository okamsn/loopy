;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package is an optional extension for the package `loopy'.
;;
;; The `loopy' macro is used to generate code for a loop, similar to `cl-loop'.
;; Unlike `cl-loop', `loopy' uses symbolic expressions instead of "clauses".
;;
;; This package provides a way to use the destructuring features of the Dash
;; library in `loopy'.
;;
;;     ;; => ((1 4)            coll1
;;     ;;     ((2 3) (5 6))    whole
;;     ;;     (2 5)            x
;;     ;;     (3 6))           y
;;     (require 'loopy-dash)
;;     (loopy (flag dash)
;;            (list (i j) '((1 (2 3)) (4 (5 6))))
;;            (collect coll1 i)
;;            (collect (whole &as x y) j)
;;            (finally-return coll1 whole x y))
;;
;; For more information, including the full list of loop commands and how to
;; extend the macro, see the main package's comprehensive Info documentation
;; under the Info node `(loopy)'.
